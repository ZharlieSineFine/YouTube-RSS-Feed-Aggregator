0:00:00.080" end="00:00:02.720So, in this video, I'm going to show you
0:00:01.520" end="00:00:04.240something I've never done on this
0:00:02.720" end="00:00:06.879channel before, and that is an end to
0:00:04.240" end="00:00:09.040end agent build. Literally from start to
0:00:06.879" end="00:00:10.719finish, from ideation all the way to
0:00:09.040" end="00:00:12.719deployment, and this actually running on
0:00:10.719" end="00:00:14.639a server and working, you can follow
0:00:12.719" end="00:00:15.839along and learn from this. And what
0:00:14.639" end="00:00:18.480we're going to build is we're going to
0:00:15.839" end="00:00:20.160create an AI news aggregator. So, this
0:00:18.480" end="00:00:21.840is going to be super exciting. So, what
0:00:20.160" end="00:00:23.359this will do once you have this
0:00:21.840" end="00:00:26.000deployed, which I will show you in this
0:00:23.359" end="00:00:28.880video, every day you will get an email
0:00:26.000" end="00:00:31.279with the latest AI news specifically
0:00:28.880" end="00:00:32.880tailored to you. We can specify YouTube
0:00:31.279" end="00:00:35.200channels that we want to follow, blog
0:00:32.880" end="00:00:37.280posts, RSS feeds. We'll bring all of
0:00:35.200" end="00:00:38.879that together in a scraping pipeline
0:00:37.280" end="00:00:41.600that will run every day, and we'll use
0:00:38.879" end="00:00:43.600AI and language models to tailor it
0:00:41.600" end="00:00:45.520specifically for us based on our
0:00:43.600" end="00:00:47.440interests. And not only that, I'm going
0:00:45.520" end="00:00:50.320to walk you through everything. The
0:00:47.440" end="00:00:52.480deployment, how I use AI assisted coding
0:00:50.320" end="00:00:54.480tools in order to plan, architect, and
0:00:52.480" end="00:00:56.399design new features, how to bring
0:00:54.480" end="00:00:58.879everything together in a Docker Compose
0:00:56.399" end="00:01:00.719file, how to deploy it via render, how
0:00:58.879" end="00:01:03.120to set up and manage the database,
0:01:00.719" end="00:01:04.720literally everything. so that by the
0:01:03.120" end="00:01:07.200end, like I've said, you'll not only
0:01:04.720" end="00:01:09.840have a serious portfolio project, but
0:01:07.200" end="00:01:12.320also you'll get a chance to understand
0:01:09.840" end="00:01:14.560and get a behind-the-scenes view of how
0:01:12.320" end="00:01:16.479I structure these projects. I'm going to
0:01:14.560" end="00:01:17.920show you everything, how I debug, how I
0:01:16.479" end="00:01:19.600plan, how I run into all of the
0:01:17.920" end="00:01:21.759challenges. So, that's going to be the
0:01:19.600" end="00:01:23.759most valuable part of this video beyond
0:01:21.759" end="00:01:26.799just creating the news aggregator. So,
0:01:23.759" end="00:01:28.640if you're serious about learning AI and
0:01:26.799" end="00:01:31.439you really want to get a deep
0:01:28.640" end="00:01:33.119understanding of what AI engineering and
0:01:31.439" end="00:01:34.880building projects like this look in the
0:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.479real world, then you want to make sure
0:01:34.880" end="00:01:38.320to check out this video. I know it's a
0:01:36.479" end="00:01:40.720long one, but it's going to pay off
0:01:38.320" end="00:01:42.799tremendously because I am sure you will
0:01:40.720" end="00:01:44.560learn a ton. Okay, so how do I recommend
0:01:42.799" end="00:01:45.600you to follow along with this video?
0:01:44.560" end="00:01:47.119Because we definitely need some
0:01:45.600" end="00:01:48.720instructions here before diving straight
0:01:47.119" end="00:01:51.040into this because you probably also want
0:01:48.720" end="00:01:53.280to know, look, am I going to commit to
0:01:51.040" end="00:01:55.119almost 4hour video? It's a big one, but
0:01:53.280" end="00:01:57.360trust me, it's going to be worth it. But
0:01:55.119" end="00:01:59.360it's big. This is going to be a private
0:01:57.360" end="00:02:01.600repository. I will leave a link down
0:01:59.360" end="00:02:02.960below this video. If you follow that, I
0:02:01.600" end="00:02:05.040will give you access to this private
0:02:02.960" end="00:02:06.399repo. Why? Because this is serious
0:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.640stuff. We share some deployment
0:02:06.399" end="00:02:10.319strategies in here. And I'm totally okay
0:02:08.640" end="00:02:11.920with sharing this, but only for people
0:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.360that actually watch this video and want
0:02:11.920" end="00:02:15.360to follow along, not some people that
0:02:13.360" end="00:02:18.080just want to Google stuff and then
0:02:15.360" end="00:02:19.599happen to uh to land on upon this
0:02:18.080" end="00:02:21.520project repository. Okay. Then the
0:02:19.599" end="00:02:23.520project structure. This video is going
0:02:21.520" end="00:02:26.480to be split up into three parts. Part
0:02:23.520" end="00:02:28.000one is on the master branch that you can
0:02:26.480" end="00:02:30.879see over here. So you can see master
0:02:28.000" end="00:02:33.120deployment deployment final. And here's
0:02:30.879" end="00:02:34.879why it's split up like this. The first
0:02:33.120" end="00:02:36.239part of this video is going to be all
0:02:34.879" end="00:02:37.920the local setup in the core
0:02:36.239" end="00:02:40.080functionality to really get the
0:02:37.920" end="00:02:41.920endto-end news aggregator ready. And at
0:02:40.080" end="00:02:43.599the end, you'll have literally an email
0:02:41.920" end="00:02:45.280from yourself sending to yourself with a
0:02:43.599" end="00:02:47.519daily digest. That's checkpoint number
0:02:45.280" end="00:02:49.920one. I created a checkpoint on the
0:02:47.519" end="00:02:52.160master branch because you can see all of
0:02:49.920" end="00:02:54.400the code snippets still here. Then we
0:02:52.160" end="00:02:56.000move into deployment and then so that's
0:02:54.400" end="00:02:57.760part two. We're going to deploy to
0:02:56.000" end="00:03:00.239render. This is where we actually bring
0:02:57.760" end="00:03:02.159this to life and then we make a lot of
0:03:00.239" end="00:03:04.000changes. We introduce new files. We
0:03:02.159" end="00:03:06.480change the environment variable. So I
0:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.720created a different branch for that. So
0:03:06.480" end="00:03:11.440you can then switch. And then also part
0:03:08.720" end="00:03:13.360number three is once we get everything
0:03:11.440" end="00:03:15.280ready, I'm going to do the final
0:03:13.360" end="00:03:17.519optimizations, some production ready
0:03:15.280" end="00:03:19.360changes and also some big refactoring.
0:03:17.519" end="00:03:20.800So that's on the deployment final
0:03:19.360" end="00:03:22.800branch. Throughout the video, this will
0:03:20.800" end="00:03:24.400all make sense. I will actually show you
0:03:22.800" end="00:03:26.560when I jump to which one so you can
0:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.239follow along. Okay. So how this video
0:03:26.560" end="00:03:30.159works, this is important because this is
0:03:28.239" end="00:03:31.760going to be very different from my other
0:03:30.159" end="00:03:33.599videos and probably also from other
0:03:31.760" end="00:03:35.200videos that you'll find on YouTube. It's
0:03:33.599" end="00:03:36.959a live coding build, so not a
0:03:35.200" end="00:03:38.560traditional step-by-step tutorial. So,
0:03:36.959" end="00:03:40.560here's what you should expect. It's
0:03:38.560" end="00:03:42.959going to be fast-paced. I code at my
0:03:40.560" end="00:03:45.680natural pace pace leveraging AI tools
0:03:42.959" end="00:03:47.840extensively. You won't see every code
0:03:45.680" end="00:03:49.440snippet or file generation in real time
0:03:47.840" end="00:03:51.200because I'm using the AI assisted
0:03:49.440" end="00:03:52.640workflow. But rest assured, everything
0:03:51.200" end="00:03:55.200is here in the repo for you to
0:03:52.640" end="00:03:58.080reference. This is, in my opinion, this
0:03:55.200" end="00:04:00.000is really going to condense 20 to 40
0:03:58.080" end="00:04:01.760hours of learning into a single session.
0:04:00.000" end="00:04:04.080Like really, if you go through this in
0:04:01.760" end="00:04:05.840the recommended way, it's it's going to
0:04:04.080" end="00:04:08.239be insane. Trust me. So, how to follow
0:04:05.840" end="00:04:09.840along? There are like two options but I
0:04:08.239" end="00:04:11.360really recommend the the first one the
0:04:09.840" end="00:04:13.200recommended approach for maximum
0:04:11.360" end="00:04:15.200learning and that is you clone the
0:04:13.200" end="00:04:17.919repository before starting this video
0:04:15.200" end="00:04:19.519link below to get access you keep a
0:04:17.919" end="00:04:21.519local copy ready so you have that
0:04:19.519" end="00:04:23.440project open but then you open up a new
0:04:21.519" end="00:04:25.520project as well so as I go through the
0:04:23.440" end="00:04:27.680video I'll show you look here's how I
0:04:25.520" end="00:04:29.280started the project you follow along and
0:04:27.680" end="00:04:31.360then what you want to do is you want to
0:04:29.280" end="00:04:33.360follow along with me now I'm going fast
0:04:31.360" end="00:04:35.360whenever you whenever feel like oh I
0:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.280can't quite catch it anymore go to the
0:04:35.360" end="00:04:38.479local cop copy everything is there. So
0:04:37.280" end="00:04:40.320you can look at the files, you can
0:04:38.479" end="00:04:41.919simply copy paste and then you can run
0:04:40.320" end="00:04:43.600the checkpoint. So whenever we do
0:04:41.919" end="00:04:45.919something, we test something, I run the
0:04:43.600" end="00:04:47.600files, you can do it like that. But that
0:04:45.919" end="00:04:49.759is really how you get to see the bigger
0:04:47.600" end="00:04:51.520picture and look at all of the pieces of
0:04:49.759" end="00:04:53.360the puzzle and bring it together. So you
0:04:51.520" end="00:04:55.840want to iterate step by step. So don't
0:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.400rush ahead. Ensure each phase works
0:04:55.840" end="00:05:01.360before moving forward. And also, this is
0:04:58.400" end="00:05:03.600important, expect confusion. That's part
0:05:01.360" end="00:05:05.360that's intentionally in this video. So,
0:05:03.600" end="00:05:07.199some parts will move fast and not be
0:05:05.360" end="00:05:09.440immediately clear. This is where the
0:05:07.199" end="00:05:11.039real learning happens because if I lay
0:05:09.440" end="00:05:13.039everything out step by step for you,
0:05:11.039" end="00:05:15.280there's in like I do in my other videos,
0:05:13.039" end="00:05:16.639there's there's room for that and you
0:05:15.280" end="00:05:18.320will go through it and it will be nice
0:05:16.639" end="00:05:19.919and everything is laid out, but this is
0:05:18.320" end="00:05:22.000where you're going to struggle, but
0:05:19.919" end="00:05:23.680that's where you'll learn a lot. So, the
0:05:22.000" end="00:05:25.600alternative is really just going to the
0:05:23.680" end="00:05:27.600deployment final and look at the readme
0:05:25.600" end="00:05:29.199docs over there and then just deploy
0:05:27.600" end="00:05:31.520that. Like I said, that's also totally
0:05:29.199" end="00:05:33.120possible, but then this is you won't
0:05:31.520" end="00:05:35.440learn anything from it and you just have
0:05:33.120" end="00:05:37.600a you have a cool news aggregator. But
0:05:35.440" end="00:05:39.759yeah, that's the approach. So why I
0:05:37.600" end="00:05:41.680recommend this? Traditional tutorials
0:05:39.759" end="00:05:44.479show you the right way to do things.
0:05:41.680" end="00:05:46.240This video shows you the real way with
0:05:44.479" end="00:05:48.320AI assistance, wrapping iteration,
0:05:46.240" end="00:05:49.440debugging, and adapting on the fly. By
0:05:48.320" end="00:05:50.800following along, hitting the same
0:05:49.440" end="00:05:52.800checkpoints, you will literally learn
0:05:50.800" end="00:05:54.160how to effectively leverage AI coding
0:05:52.800" end="00:05:56.000tools. So that's something you'll learn
0:05:54.160" end="00:05:57.759how I use them. Understand the thought
0:05:56.000" end="00:06:00.160process behind architectural decisions.
0:05:57.759" end="00:06:02.320I will be very like clear about the
0:06:00.160" end="00:06:04.240decisions I make. Experience realw world
0:06:02.320" end="00:06:06.160development workflows all the way from
0:06:04.240" end="00:06:08.240planning, architecture, ideation to
0:06:06.160" end="00:06:10.000deployment and build muscle memory
0:06:08.240" end="00:06:11.759through hands-on practice because we'll
0:06:10.000" end="00:06:13.680move files a lot. We use the code
0:06:11.759" end="00:06:15.520editor. We we'll do a lot of things. So
0:06:13.680" end="00:06:17.600the most valuable learning happens when
0:06:15.520" end="00:06:19.360you struggle, reference the code and
0:06:17.600" end="00:06:20.960push through the next point. All right.
0:06:19.360" end="00:06:22.960So that was the info, everything that I
0:06:20.960" end="00:06:25.600needed to lay out first. So now we go
0:06:22.960" end="00:06:28.560into building mode. All right. So let's
0:06:25.600" end="00:06:30.960get to work. So whenever I would start a
0:06:28.560" end="00:06:32.880new project, I would come over to one of
0:06:30.960" end="00:06:35.360my repository folders. Let's do this one
0:06:32.880" end="00:06:37.600in the personal repositories. And then
0:06:35.360" end="00:06:39.759what I would do is I would you do a UV
0:06:37.600" end="00:06:43.039in it. And then I would give the project
0:06:39.759" end="00:06:46.880a name. So let's call it AI news
0:06:43.039" end="00:06:51.520aggregator. That sounds aggregator. That
0:06:46.880" end="00:06:54.720sounds about right. Okay. Let's go into
0:06:51.520" end="00:06:58.000that project folder and then open it up
0:06:54.720" end="00:07:00.560in cursor so we can start laying the
0:06:58.000" end="00:07:03.520foundation for this. All right, so we
0:07:00.560" end="00:07:06.160have a clean setup over here. Now let's
0:07:03.520" end="00:07:08.560save this as a workspace so we can
0:07:06.160" end="00:07:11.280easily open it up. And now the first
0:07:08.560" end="00:07:14.720thing that I really want to do over here
0:07:11.280" end="00:07:16.800is start to brainstorm on some features.
0:07:14.720" end="00:07:19.280So we're going to build an AI news
0:07:16.800" end="00:07:21.199aggregator, right? I still have no idea
0:07:19.280" end="00:07:23.840what this is going to look like, but but
0:07:21.199" end="00:07:25.759I have a general idea of how I like to
0:07:23.840" end="00:07:27.199build things. And usually nowadays, what
0:07:25.759" end="00:07:30.639I always like to do when I start
0:07:27.199" end="00:07:33.120something new is I want to use some kind
0:07:30.639" end="00:07:35.680of speech to text tool in order to just
0:07:33.120" end="00:07:37.440do a brain dump and get my ideas out.
0:07:35.680" end="00:07:40.000And then from there, we can start to
0:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.520plan using AI. And in this case, I'm
0:07:40.000" end="00:07:43.840going to do that with incursor. And I'm
0:07:41.520" end="00:07:46.000going to do that with the composer one
0:07:43.840" end="00:07:47.440model, which I've been really liking
0:07:46.000" end="00:07:48.800lately. But you can follow along with
0:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.440anything. But first, what I'm going to
0:07:48.800" end="00:07:52.880do is I am going to use a tool that I'm
0:07:51.440" end="00:07:56.000actually working on right now. It's
0:07:52.880" end="00:07:58.000called Glido. And if you're lucky and
0:07:56.000" end="00:08:00.000you check below this video, there will
0:07:58.000" end="00:08:03.039be a link where you can test it out for
0:08:00.000" end="00:08:05.280free right now. If you're too late, the
0:08:03.039" end="00:08:07.360public beta that we're running right now
0:08:05.280" end="00:08:09.520will probably already be closed. But let
0:08:07.360" end="00:08:11.360me show you what this can do right now.
0:08:09.520" end="00:08:14.080Let's start brainstorming. So what I
0:08:11.360" end="00:08:16.800want to build is an AI news aggregator
0:08:14.080" end="00:08:19.280where I can take multiple sources. So
0:08:16.800" end="00:08:22.080for example, YouTube channels and I want
0:08:19.280" end="00:08:24.800for example blog posts from OpenAI and
0:08:22.080" end="00:08:27.120Mropic and I want to scrape those put
0:08:24.800" end="00:08:29.599them into a database where we have some
0:08:27.120" end="00:08:32.000kind of structure where we have sources
0:08:29.599" end="00:08:34.320we have let's call them articles and
0:08:32.000" end="00:08:38.000then what I want to do is I want to run
0:08:34.320" end="00:08:40.000a daily digest where we're going to take
0:08:38.000" end="00:08:42.000all of the articles from within that
0:08:40.000" end="00:08:43.599time frame and we're going to do an LLM
0:08:42.000" end="00:08:45.519summary around that and then based on
0:08:43.599" end="00:08:46.399the user insights that we specify in
0:08:45.519" end="00:08:49.519some kind of
0:08:46.399" end="00:08:51.440agent system prompt. We can generate a
0:08:49.519" end="00:08:54.240daily digest which is going to be short
0:08:51.440" end="00:08:57.600snippets with a link to the original
0:08:54.240" end="00:08:59.680source. Now from the YouTube channels I
0:08:57.600" end="00:09:02.640want to I want to be able to create a
0:08:59.680" end="00:09:05.440list of channels and then we want to get
0:09:02.640" end="00:09:07.279the latest videos from those channels. I
0:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.360think we can use the YouTube RSS feed
0:09:07.279" end="00:09:12.160for that and for for the blog posts we
0:09:09.360" end="00:09:15.040can just have URLs that we can scrape
0:09:12.160" end="00:09:17.680for that. Okay. So I want everything
0:09:15.040" end="00:09:20.160built in a Python back end. I want to
0:09:17.680" end="00:09:24.640use a Postgress SQL database. I want to
0:09:20.160" end="00:09:26.560use SQL alchemy in order to define the
0:09:24.640" end="00:09:28.640database models and then to also create
0:09:26.560" end="00:09:30.959the tables. I want the project structure
0:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.880to be an app folder where all the app
0:09:30.959" end="00:09:34.720logic is in. And then I also want a
0:09:32.880" end="00:09:37.360docker folder where we first create a
0:09:34.720" end="00:09:40.240very minimal setup for the Postgress SQL
0:09:37.360" end="00:09:41.920database. And then that will probably be
0:09:40.240" end="00:09:43.519starting point. We want to make sure
0:09:41.920" end="00:09:46.080that later down the line, we can easily
0:09:43.519" end="00:09:49.600deploy the whole app to render and then
0:09:46.080" end="00:09:52.000also schedule it every 24 hours to run
0:09:49.600" end="00:09:54.080the reports, get everything. And then
0:09:52.000" end="00:09:56.240when we've created the daily digest, I
0:09:54.080" end="00:09:58.399want to send an email to my personal
0:09:56.240" end="00:09:59.600inbox with this. So that's that's what I
0:09:58.399" end="00:10:02.240have in mind. I think that would be
0:09:59.600" end="00:10:04.000pretty cool to build.
0:10:02.240" end="00:10:06.320Okay. So now you can see with the help
0:10:04.000" end="00:10:08.240of Glido, we have the whole text in
0:10:06.320" end="00:10:11.680there. It's a very long string of
0:10:08.240" end="00:10:13.360everything that I was just saying. So
0:10:11.680" end="00:10:15.120now this is something we can just leave
0:10:13.360" end="00:10:17.360here. It's kind of like a scratch pad
0:10:15.120" end="00:10:19.600and I'm just going to just plug that
0:10:17.360" end="00:10:21.600into the composer one right now. And I'm
0:10:19.600" end="00:10:23.200going I'm going to plan mode. So I'm not
0:10:21.600" end="00:10:24.640going to build just yet. I'm first just
0:10:23.200" end="00:10:26.640going to check like look what is it
0:10:24.640" end="00:10:28.959going to come up with. Now you can use
0:10:26.640" end="00:10:32.720any of your favorite AI tool for that.
0:10:28.959" end="00:10:35.200But the idea about leveraging AI really
0:10:32.720" end="00:10:38.000is we want to be in control. We are the
0:10:35.200" end="00:10:40.399architect and you saw probably already
0:10:38.000" end="00:10:43.360that like within my description I was
0:10:40.399" end="00:10:46.560already quite specific Postgress I want
0:10:43.360" end="00:10:48.880SQL alchemy Python based I want a folder
0:10:46.560" end="00:10:51.279like this and a folder like that and
0:10:48.880" end="00:10:53.040that's going to really be helpful so
0:10:51.279" end="00:10:56.000okay let's see so it's going to ask some
0:10:53.040" end="00:10:59.040follow-up questions llm so let's see I'm
0:10:56.000" end="00:11:01.279just so yeah let's use open AI how
0:10:59.040" end="00:11:03.200should we send emails I have no idea I
0:11:01.279" end="00:11:05.839want it to be as easy as possible and
0:11:03.200" end="00:11:07.839ideally I want viewers of this this
0:11:05.839" end="00:11:09.920whole build to be easy to follow along.
0:11:07.839" end="00:11:11.200So, ideally a free surface, but let me
0:11:09.920" end="00:11:15.120know what do you think is the easiest
0:11:11.200" end="00:11:17.279way. Blog scraping. I want full I want
0:11:15.120" end="00:11:20.640the full context of the page. User
0:11:17.279" end="00:11:23.200insights prompt. Where should the agent
0:11:20.640" end="00:11:25.440system prompt live? We're going to
0:11:23.200" end="00:11:27.120create a separate folder called agent
0:11:25.440" end="00:11:30.000where we'll put all of that in. And the
0:11:27.120" end="00:11:32.320Docker setup should
0:11:30.000" end="00:11:33.920include a postcard SQL container. Yeah,
0:11:32.320" end="00:11:35.519we're not going to connect to an in
0:11:33.920" end="00:11:38.560external database. We'll do everything
0:11:35.519" end="00:11:41.279from with inside the project.
0:11:38.560" end="00:11:43.519Please adjust the plan accordingly.
0:11:41.279" end="00:11:45.120All right. So, it updated the plan. That
0:11:43.519" end="00:11:48.000should look good for now. So, let's
0:11:45.120" end="00:11:50.480actually ask it. Awesome. Can you now
0:11:48.000" end="00:11:52.720create the project structures for me?
0:11:50.480" end="00:11:54.160So, just lay out the folders already.
0:11:52.720" end="00:11:57.920You don't have to create the files just
0:11:54.160" end="00:11:59.440yet. And also give me the u add command
0:11:57.920" end="00:12:00.880with all of the libraries that we're
0:11:59.440" end="00:12:02.480probably going to need. Don't add them.
0:12:00.880" end="00:12:04.720add them to the pi project autotoml. I
0:12:02.480" end="00:12:06.560will run it myself.
0:12:04.720" end="00:12:09.040Okay. So, what I'm going to do right now
0:12:06.560" end="00:12:10.959is look, this is I really love this. So,
0:12:09.040" end="00:12:13.360now asking for time. Yeah, we can run
0:12:10.959" end="00:12:16.399this. It's going to create all of the
0:12:13.360" end="00:12:18.639folders and let's see. We can already
0:12:16.399" end="00:12:22.800say later down the line. Okay, let's
0:12:18.639" end="00:12:26.639see. It's going to ask all of the
0:12:22.800" end="00:12:29.040libraries and let's see. I'm going to
0:12:26.639" end="00:12:32.480create an environment with UV right now.
0:12:29.040" end="00:12:34.560So, let's do a UV f in here. And then
0:12:32.480" end="00:12:36.639make sure we select that within that
0:12:34.560" end="00:12:38.880project. Is that already selected? Yes.
0:12:36.639" end="00:12:43.120And I'm going to do UV add. And then I'm
0:12:38.880" end="00:12:45.440going to at least have these in here for
0:12:43.120" end="00:12:48.480now. And I'm also going to do a UV add.
0:12:45.440" end="00:12:50.240And I'm going to do an IPI kernel. I'm
0:12:48.480" end="00:12:53.120going to add that as a development
0:12:50.240" end="00:12:56.480dependency. All right. So, that is
0:12:53.120" end="00:12:58.639looking good for now. Okay. Let's see.
0:12:56.480" end="00:13:01.120We can actually have the agent folder in
0:12:58.639" end="00:13:03.200here. That's all good. Okay. So, this is
0:13:01.120" end="00:13:04.880the setup. So, right now, I quickly want
0:13:03.200" end="00:13:06.480to test the core functionality. So,
0:13:04.880" end="00:13:08.399what's going to make or break this
0:13:06.480" end="00:13:12.000application is getting the actual
0:13:08.399" end="00:13:14.560sources. So I'm going to start with a
0:13:12.000" end="00:13:17.040YouTube surface where I'm going to say
0:13:14.560" end="00:13:21.519okay let's now actually start with
0:13:17.040" end="00:13:26.320building out the YouTube surface where I
0:13:21.519" end="00:13:29.760want to specify a list of channels and
0:13:26.320" end="00:13:31.680then for those channels I want to create
0:13:29.760" end="00:13:34.000a surface where through the YouTube RSS
0:13:31.680" end="00:13:35.440feed we somehow need I think we need to
0:13:34.000" end="00:13:36.720figure out the ID or something like
0:13:35.440" end="00:13:39.120that. You need to check what the input
0:13:36.720" end="00:13:41.279for the RSS feed is going to be and then
0:13:39.120" end="00:13:43.760get the latest videos and then also
0:13:41.279" end="00:13:45.519filter them by time. So every day we can
0:13:43.760" end="00:13:48.240essentially do a search and see look in
0:13:45.519" end="00:13:50.560the last 24 hours or so is there a new
0:13:48.240" end="00:13:52.399video for the channel that we are
0:13:50.560" end="00:13:53.839creating. Later we can get more specific
0:13:52.399" end="00:13:55.680about this when we store them into the
0:13:53.839" end="00:13:58.000database. But let's just first test that
0:13:55.680" end="00:14:00.880core functionality to see if we can set
0:13:58.000" end="00:14:03.360that up and then also use the YouTube
0:14:00.880" end="00:14:05.519transcript API Python library in order
0:14:03.360" end="00:14:08.399to get the transcript. That's the first
0:14:05.519" end="00:14:10.079surface that I want you to work on.
0:14:08.399" end="00:14:12.160Okay. So, we have that in there. Now,
0:14:10.079" end="00:14:15.440I'm going to agent mode because right
0:14:12.160" end="00:14:17.519now I want this to build some stuff. So,
0:14:15.440" end="00:14:19.360even though we have the plan over here
0:14:17.519" end="00:14:21.600and it actually recommended to start
0:14:19.360" end="00:14:23.839with the database models, I actually
0:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.760first like to see something tangible.
0:14:23.839" end="00:14:28.720Let's see. So, the scrapers is here.
0:14:25.760" end="00:14:30.560Step number four. So, let's just f first
0:14:28.720" end="00:14:32.880work on this. And then in the meantime,
0:14:30.560" end="00:14:35.839so while this is running, I'm actually
0:14:32.880" end="00:14:38.560going to let's see OpenAI because for
0:14:35.839" end="00:14:41.440example, GPT 5.1 just released. So they
0:14:38.560" end="00:14:43.440have this news URL over here. This is
0:14:41.440" end="00:14:45.600just going to be my scratchpad where I'm
0:14:43.440" end="00:14:47.760going to say look, I have that and then
0:14:45.600" end="00:14:51.120entropic. Let's see. We have the blog
0:14:47.760" end="00:14:53.120post. What does entropic have? We have
0:14:51.120" end="00:14:56.079research.
0:14:53.120" end="00:14:59.120That's interesting.
0:14:56.079" end="00:15:02.240We have research. We have engineering.
0:14:59.120" end="00:15:04.800Let's actually see what we got over here
0:15:02.240" end="00:15:07.920right now. So,
0:15:04.800" end="00:15:10.720it created the scrapers. So, here's the
0:15:07.920" end="00:15:13.680YouTube scraper. Do we already have the
0:15:10.720" end="00:15:17.360YouTube transcript? No, that's not in
0:15:13.680" end="00:15:22.560there. So, we need to add that. So, UV
0:15:17.360" end="00:15:25.519at Oh, I'm messing this up. Uv
0:15:22.560" end="00:15:28.880YouTube transcript API. What? What's
0:15:25.519" end="00:15:33.040going on? What did I miss?
0:15:28.880" end="00:15:35.040UI at YouTube transcript API. Okay. I
0:15:33.040" end="00:15:37.440don't know what was going on there.
0:15:35.040" end="00:15:39.519Okay. So now we have that. So now can we
0:15:37.440" end="00:15:42.480actually test that? So we have a channel
0:15:39.519" end="00:15:46.160ID and I always like to do like look if
0:15:42.480" end="00:15:49.839name equals main and then last channel
0:15:46.160" end="00:15:51.360ID. So let's actually see how this works
0:15:49.839" end="00:15:53.680because one of the tricky things with
0:15:51.360" end="00:15:58.639YouTube, let's see. Let's say if you go
0:15:53.680" end="00:16:02.320to my channel, we can actually do that
0:15:58.639" end="00:16:05.279like this. So my channel slug or handle
0:16:02.320" end="00:16:07.519is at Dave Eilar. But the thing is
0:16:05.279" end="00:16:10.959whenever you work programmatically with
0:16:07.519" end="00:16:13.920something in YouTube, you want to get if
0:16:10.959" end="00:16:17.600channel if username. Oh, I think it
0:16:13.920" end="00:16:20.959work. It works both ways. Let's actually
0:16:17.600" end="00:16:24.639test that. Let's go in here. I want to
0:16:20.959" end="00:16:30.880be able to plug in
0:16:24.639" end="00:16:34.800the full channel URL like this. Will it
0:16:30.880" end="00:16:36.320work? I am just asking. So
0:16:34.800" end="00:16:39.680username.
0:16:36.320" end="00:16:43.920So it's going to add another some other
0:16:39.680" end="00:16:46.560functionality to this. So okay,
0:16:43.920" end="00:16:48.639actually you know what? I'm going to I'm
0:16:46.560" end="00:16:50.079going to undo that because that is if we
0:16:48.639" end="00:16:52.639can just use the username that's
0:16:50.079" end="00:16:56.720actually a lot cleaner. So let's
0:16:52.639" end="00:16:59.040actually try and do username and let's
0:16:56.720" end="00:17:00.959see what this looks like. So first let's
0:16:59.040" end="00:17:03.120see if
0:17:00.959" end="00:17:05.120Python can actually run this without any
0:17:03.120" end="00:17:08.240import errors. That would already be ooh
0:17:05.120" end="00:17:09.760that would be a big win already because
0:17:08.240" end="00:17:11.439yeah we're not using any because
0:17:09.760" end="00:17:13.199whenever you're setting up a new Python
0:17:11.439" end="00:17:15.839project and you're working with multiple
0:17:13.199" end="00:17:17.679files and folders we we will run into
0:17:15.839" end="00:17:20.319that like managing the the folder
0:17:17.679" end="00:17:21.919structure and inputs is always messy. So
0:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.079let's first actually see what we're
0:17:21.919" end="00:17:26.720doing. So we're using and this is
0:17:24.079" end="00:17:28.799something I I just know you can use the
0:17:26.720" end="00:17:30.320XML feed for YouTube but let's actually
0:17:28.799" end="00:17:31.919see if this works with a username. I
0:17:30.320" end="00:17:35.520know it works with a channel ID, but
0:17:31.919" end="00:17:37.760does this work? So, this doesn't work.
0:17:35.520" end="00:17:40.320Okay, so after a little bit of digging,
0:17:37.760" end="00:17:42.320it seemed a little bit annoying to get
0:17:40.320" end="00:17:44.080it using a username. It's possible
0:17:42.320" end="00:17:45.919through the YouTube API, but that
0:17:44.080" end="00:17:48.400requires a separate dependency. So, for
0:17:45.919" end="00:17:52.160now, we are just going to work with
0:17:48.400" end="00:17:53.679channel ID. So, let's actually say, hey,
0:17:52.160" end="00:17:54.880look, for now, I want you to clean up
0:17:53.679" end="00:17:57.120this file. Make it as simple as
0:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.600possible. So we can only it only accepts
0:17:57.120" end="00:18:01.360a channel ID because the usernames don't
0:17:59.600" end="00:18:03.760work. Let's clean up this file and then
0:18:01.360" end="00:18:08.000we test it.
0:18:03.760" end="00:18:10.240Okay. So then let's see coming back to
0:18:08.000" end="00:18:13.760what we got going on over here. I think
0:18:10.240" end="00:18:19.280I had my own. Yeah, this was my channel
0:18:13.760" end="00:18:21.280ID. So let's come back here and let's
0:18:19.280" end="00:18:23.919get into
0:18:21.280" end="00:18:25.440let's see. So this is now very focused.
0:18:23.919" end="00:18:27.360So we can actually you know what let's
0:18:25.440" end="00:18:29.280get rid of this we don't need this I
0:18:27.360" end="00:18:33.120just want to test it in here. So we say
0:18:29.280" end="00:18:35.280if name equals main get latest video and
0:18:33.120" end="00:18:38.240then how does that work in here we have
0:18:35.280" end="00:18:41.840the RSS feed we can extract the video
0:18:38.240" end="00:18:46.480get latest videos cut off time and there
0:18:41.840" end="00:18:47.919is a default so I my last published
0:18:46.480" end="00:18:50.160video was from a week ago or so
0:18:47.919" end="00:18:53.039something like let's just do 200 hours
0:18:50.160" end="00:18:55.840just so we can cast a wide net in here.
0:18:53.039" end="00:18:58.480Now let's see if this is going to work.
0:18:55.840" end="00:19:01.360So what what will it will return? Get
0:18:58.480" end="00:19:04.400latest videos. It will return the feed.
0:19:01.360" end="00:19:08.000Is that it? Yeah, feed. It will return
0:19:04.400" end="00:19:09.840videos. So we're going to say videos is
0:19:08.000" end="00:19:11.919let's see if this works. Is there
0:19:09.840" end="00:19:14.400something in here? There is something in
0:19:11.919" end="00:19:17.600here. We got the video. Beautiful.
0:19:14.400" end="00:19:21.280Title, URL, video. Perfect. This is
0:19:17.600" end="00:19:23.919everything that I want at this point. So
0:19:21.280" end="00:19:27.520we got scrapers, we got YouTube. Yes.
0:19:23.919" end="00:19:30.559Okay, this is perfect. Now next what I
0:19:27.520" end="00:19:32.480want to do is let's see.
0:19:30.559" end="00:19:35.200Okay, perfect. This now works. What I
0:19:32.480" end="00:19:38.640now want to create is a surface inside
0:19:35.200" end="00:19:43.600the surface folder where we can take a
0:19:38.640" end="00:19:45.600YouTube video URL or a YouTube video ID.
0:19:43.600" end="00:19:47.679And then let's actually just do it for
0:19:45.600" end="00:19:50.080the video ID. That's that's easier. And
0:19:47.679" end="00:19:51.280I want to get the transcript in text
0:19:50.080" end="00:19:55.360format. And we're going to use the
0:19:51.280" end="00:19:57.600YouTube transcript uh API for that. And
0:19:55.360" end="00:20:00.480let's see, let's try and implement a
0:19:57.600" end="00:20:03.840very clean and minimal version of this.
0:20:00.480" end="00:20:08.320I'm going to just like copy paste this
0:20:03.840" end="00:20:11.280example output of the scraper
0:20:08.320" end="00:20:14.320so we know what we have. And I'm going
0:20:11.280" end="00:20:16.480to YouTube transcript API. I've worked
0:20:14.320" end="00:20:19.120with this one before. And what I'm just
0:20:16.480" end="00:20:23.520going to check is sometimes when you
0:20:19.120" end="00:20:25.760just let AI rip at things, it will just
0:20:23.520" end="00:20:28.159pretty much
0:20:25.760" end="00:20:31.120like make things overly verbose. So
0:20:28.159" end="00:20:33.280let's just make sure that it actually
0:20:31.120" end="00:20:36.480Okay, got it. That it actually focuses
0:20:33.280" end="00:20:38.720on a very clean implementation. So okay,
0:20:36.480" end="00:20:40.559we're making progress here. We're making
0:20:38.720" end="00:20:42.240progress. So, we're going to create a
0:20:40.559" end="00:20:44.799surface.
0:20:42.240" end="00:20:47.360YouTube get transcript.
0:20:44.799" end="00:20:49.679And we have the text in here. Okay.
0:20:47.360" end="00:20:52.640Let's also test this one. If name equal
0:20:49.679" end="00:20:56.720main, print get transcript. We need a
0:20:52.640" end="00:21:00.400video ID. What did we have? So, let's
0:20:56.720" end="00:21:02.720see. Let's run this one more time. And
0:21:00.400" end="00:21:06.080let's see. Print.
0:21:02.720" end="00:21:08.559There we go. So, look, I can now just
0:21:06.080" end="00:21:12.320start to test this. Let's see. Get
0:21:08.559" end="00:21:14.480transcript. Okay. Will this work? None.
0:21:12.320" end="00:21:16.240Okay. This is something. So then we need
0:21:14.480" end="00:21:18.559to do a little bit of digging here to
0:21:16.240" end="00:21:20.799see why is this not working. We do
0:21:18.559" end="00:21:26.159YouTube get transcript video ID and we
0:21:20.799" end="00:21:28.480join the text. Why is this not returning
0:21:26.159" end="00:21:31.120fetch video ID?
0:21:28.480" end="00:21:34.080I'm just going to
0:21:31.120" end="00:21:37.760do a little bit of digging here to see.
0:21:34.080" end="00:21:40.159Look. Oh, wait. Just some manual
0:21:37.760" end="00:21:43.679tinkering over here. Can we actually get
0:21:40.159" end="00:21:46.720this? Let's first import this. Let's get
0:21:43.679" end="00:21:48.400rid of this. Let's just follow Let's
0:21:46.720" end="00:21:53.120just follow the examples. Look at the
0:21:48.400" end="00:21:56.640doc. So, we need we do it like this.
0:21:53.120" end="00:21:59.840Yes. And then result is this. So, we
0:21:56.640" end="00:22:01.440initial initialize the class and then we
0:21:59.840" end="00:22:03.840fetch.
0:22:01.440" end="00:22:06.960So it's not get transcript, it's fetch.
0:22:03.840" end="00:22:09.280Then we do result. There we go. That
0:22:06.960" end="00:22:11.200seems about right. So that's what I was
0:22:09.280" end="00:22:12.640saying, right? So sometimes when even
0:22:11.200" end="00:22:15.760when you're working with established
0:22:12.640" end="00:22:17.520libraries, it can be very it can get
0:22:15.760" end="00:22:19.600into a slippery slope. So whenever
0:22:17.520" end="00:22:21.440possible, always try and reference some
0:22:19.600" end="00:22:23.280kind of like quick start documentation.
0:22:21.440" end="00:22:24.880So we just make sure that we go into the
0:22:23.280" end="00:22:29.600right direction. So now if I get in
0:22:24.880" end="00:22:33.120here, we should looks we still have uh
0:22:29.600" end="00:22:36.640get transcripts. Is this correct with
0:22:33.120" end="00:22:39.280YouTube transcript API fetch fetch ID
0:22:36.640" end="00:22:44.159return for transcript? So it's still
0:22:39.280" end="00:22:47.760messing up like really try and
0:22:44.159" end="00:22:49.280emulate this. So we do fetch video ID.
0:22:47.760" end="00:22:50.880This should actually just be a
0:22:49.280" end="00:22:52.320transcript.
0:22:50.880" end="00:22:54.400And then what what do we get back in
0:22:52.320" end="00:22:56.240here? So we have a result. So fetch
0:22:54.400" end="00:22:58.400transcript
0:22:56.240" end="00:23:00.320return the transcript
0:22:58.400" end="00:23:04.000for now just to see if the function is
0:23:00.320" end="00:23:07.520working. So this this should work. Yeah.
0:23:04.000" end="00:23:09.679Okay. Now we need to figure out and I'm
0:23:07.520" end="00:23:12.000just being lazy here. I'm going to say
0:23:09.679" end="00:23:13.200look this is the data model the fetch
0:23:12.000" end="00:23:15.120transcript model that we're getting
0:23:13.200" end="00:23:17.440back. How can we just get the text from
0:23:15.120" end="00:23:19.520this? I'm just going to plug it in there
0:23:17.440" end="00:23:22.960so it can have a look at the structure.
0:23:19.520" end="00:23:25.039And then let's see in here. It will
0:23:22.960" end="00:23:27.679dissect that. And we can see, look, we
0:23:25.039" end="00:23:32.320have everything in here. So, we're going
0:23:27.679" end="00:23:35.760to join here. Okay. And I Yes, looking
0:23:32.320" end="00:23:38.960good. All right. That sounds like the
0:23:35.760" end="00:23:41.600start of my tutorial. Okay. Perfect. So,
0:23:38.960" end="00:23:43.600now we have a surface that can get us
0:23:41.600" end="00:23:46.720the transcript. So, that's really good.
0:23:43.600" end="00:23:49.840So, we have Let's see what's in here.
0:23:46.720" end="00:23:52.880There's also I see it was trying to
0:23:49.840" end="00:23:56.320combine that in here which is actually
0:23:52.880" end="00:23:58.000which is not a bad idea to do. Okay. So
0:23:56.320" end="00:23:59.520now we're we're going to this is already
0:23:58.000" end="00:24:01.120already a little bit tricky. I'm going
0:23:59.520" end="00:24:02.559to I'm going to commit this project and
0:24:01.120" end="00:24:05.360then then we're already going to do a
0:24:02.559" end="00:24:06.559quick refactor. So let's see are we
0:24:05.360" end="00:24:08.960still running here? We are still
0:24:06.559" end="00:24:11.120running. I am going to say look this
0:24:08.960" end="00:24:13.120right now just I'm just going to do a
0:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.880project in it and I'm going to say I'm
0:24:13.120" end="00:24:18.240going to publish this branch and I want
0:24:14.880" end="00:24:21.200to do this to a private repository.
0:24:18.240" end="00:24:23.120So let's push this. So now we can
0:24:21.200" end="00:24:24.720because now we have we have laid the
0:24:23.120" end="00:24:27.200groundwork. All right people we're we're
0:24:24.720" end="00:24:29.039getting there. So now whenever our AI
0:24:27.200" end="00:24:30.960agent is going off and doing crazy
0:24:29.039" end="00:24:33.919things we want to be able to track all
0:24:30.960" end="00:24:35.679of the changes. So I'm going to say look
0:24:33.919" end="00:24:37.840perfect. This is working right now and
0:24:35.679" end="00:24:40.960the file is currently selected. I want
0:24:37.840" end="00:24:43.120you to migrate this function to the get
0:24:40.960" end="00:24:46.159transcript and I want you to put
0:24:43.120" end="00:24:48.559everything into a nice YouTube. You know
0:24:46.159" end="00:24:50.000what actually
0:24:48.559" end="00:24:51.600how should we do it? Yeah, I want you to
0:24:50.000" end="00:24:53.600create put it in a scraper and I want
0:24:51.600" end="00:24:55.760you want you to create a YouTube scraper
0:24:53.600" end="00:24:57.840surface. So put it all nicely into a
0:24:55.760" end="00:24:59.919single class so we can have a nice
0:24:57.840" end="00:25:03.360interface to work with this. That was a
0:24:59.919" end="00:25:05.840little bit of a fake instruction, but it
0:25:03.360" end="00:25:08.320will probably understand what we need to
0:25:05.840" end="00:25:10.559do because pretty much what I want in
0:25:08.320" end="00:25:13.520here, I want I want a nice surface
0:25:10.559" end="00:25:15.520class. I want to work in an
0:25:13.520" end="00:25:18.640objectoriented programming way. So,
0:25:15.520" end="00:25:22.320look, a YouTube scraper. Beautiful.
0:25:18.640" end="00:25:25.760So, now extract VOD. Get the transcript.
0:25:22.320" end="00:25:27.840That all looks good. Okay, perfect. So,
0:25:25.760" end="00:25:31.200now we don't need this anymore. And I
0:25:27.840" end="00:25:34.720can pretty much get rid of this. And I
0:25:31.200" end="00:25:37.360can start to test this where I can say
0:25:34.720" end="00:25:39.279scraper. You always want to test this
0:25:37.360" end="00:25:41.279one more time.
0:25:39.279" end="00:25:45.520Okay, we have the YouTube scraper. And
0:25:41.279" end="00:25:47.039then I'm going to say transcripts
0:25:45.520" end="00:25:49.039is
0:25:47.039" end="00:25:51.760get transcript.
0:25:49.039" end="00:25:53.679So this now works as standalone self
0:25:51.760" end="00:25:56.640video ID. And then here we have the
0:25:53.679" end="00:25:59.600channel ID. Yeah, perfect. So now this
0:25:56.640" end="00:26:02.960should get us a transcript. And what's
0:25:59.600" end="00:26:08.000in here? Yeah. Okay. Perfect. And then
0:26:02.960" end="00:26:10.400what else we need? We need the channel
0:26:08.000" end="00:26:12.559videos.
0:26:10.400" end="00:26:15.840That should also still work. So let's
0:26:12.559" end="00:26:18.320see if that still works. Beautiful.
0:26:15.840" end="00:26:20.480Okay. Now here we have two pieces of the
0:26:18.320" end="00:26:24.159puzzle because now we can pretty much
0:26:20.480" end="00:26:27.440dump any channel in here. get the latest
0:26:24.159" end="00:26:31.520videos. Then we can take the video ID
0:26:27.440" end="00:26:33.760and then we can plug that into the
0:26:31.520" end="00:26:37.039transcript. Okay, awesome. Now, what I
0:26:33.760" end="00:26:40.720want to do in this YouTube scraper, I
0:26:37.039" end="00:26:42.720want to define a pyentic model. Two pyic
0:26:40.720" end="00:26:44.400models actually. One for a channel
0:26:42.720" end="00:26:47.200video, and I'll dump the schema down
0:26:44.400" end="00:26:50.880below. and then also one for the
0:26:47.200" end="00:26:54.320transcript which is just going to
0:26:50.880" end="00:26:55.840contain a text field. But this way we
0:26:54.320" end="00:26:57.520exactly know what type of data models
0:26:55.840" end="00:27:01.840we're working with. You can just create
0:26:57.520" end="00:27:03.760the models here in this file.
0:27:01.840" end="00:27:05.679Okay. Boom. Plugging that in there right
0:27:03.760" end="00:27:08.159now. So what I'm now going to do so the
0:27:05.679" end="00:27:10.159AI will now like create pyntic base
0:27:08.159" end="00:27:12.400models here. So we can make our
0:27:10.159" end="00:27:14.480application more type safe. So it's
0:27:12.400" end="00:27:16.159going to add pyic in there. Look. So now
0:27:14.480" end="00:27:18.159beautiful we have a transcript and we
0:27:16.159" end="00:27:20.400have a channel video ID and then it's
0:27:18.159" end="00:27:23.679all it should also update the the
0:27:20.400" end="00:27:27.200functions in here so that the output
0:27:23.679" end="00:27:30.480yeah let's see is going to be in that
0:27:27.200" end="00:27:32.159format. Perfect. Okay checking
0:27:30.480" end="00:27:33.919everything.
0:27:32.159" end="00:27:37.520And this is going to really help us
0:27:33.919" end="00:27:40.400later down the line so that we know when
0:27:37.520" end="00:27:42.000we are working with the data we exactly
0:27:40.400" end="00:27:44.000know what type of data we're dealing
0:27:42.000" end="00:27:46.240with. and our IDE will also help with
0:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.159autocomplete. So, let me show you what
0:27:46.240" end="00:27:51.679that looks like. And we're going to add
0:27:48.159" end="00:27:54.880a UV at pientic.
0:27:51.679" end="00:28:00.399So, we have that in here. And then let's
0:27:54.880" end="00:28:02.480get rid of this. And now, let's get into
0:28:00.399" end="00:28:05.279let's see optional. Now, what where is
0:28:02.480" end="00:28:07.840this coming from? I think I just need to
0:28:05.279" end="00:28:09.919run everything. Yeah, we good. We good.
0:28:07.840" end="00:28:11.600Okay. So now if I initialize the YouTube
0:28:09.919" end="00:28:14.720scraper, let let's see if this still
0:28:11.600" end="00:28:17.360works. I hope it does. Yeah, look. So
0:28:14.720" end="00:28:20.399now what you'll find is that this now is
0:28:17.360" end="00:28:24.640actually a trans we're getting a
0:28:20.399" end="00:28:26.960transcript back. So now in order to
0:28:24.640" end="00:28:29.200pretty much print the transcript, we do
0:28:26.960" end="00:28:30.720we could do print transcript.ext. And if
0:28:29.200" end="00:28:32.880we later decide we want to store
0:28:30.720" end="00:28:35.279additional metadata on here as well,
0:28:32.880" end="00:28:38.480that works. And now the if we get the
0:28:35.279" end="00:28:41.919channel videos you'll find that we also
0:28:38.480" end="00:28:44.880get a data model back and in a list. So
0:28:41.919" end="00:28:48.880this is going to be a list of channel
0:28:44.880" end="00:28:53.600videos. So now we can let's actually is
0:28:48.880" end="00:28:57.039from yeah we can import that. Yes. Let's
0:28:53.600" end="00:28:59.679do it like this. Okay. So
0:28:57.039" end="00:29:01.200now this is already very nice and neat
0:28:59.679" end="00:29:03.440to work with. So this is a very good
0:29:01.200" end="00:29:05.039best practice to start working around.
0:29:03.440" end="00:29:07.120So now we have the channel videos in
0:29:05.039" end="00:29:09.039here. All right. Awesome. Let's clean
0:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.600this up. So we have a very good starting
0:29:09.039" end="00:29:14.399point with our YouTube scraper over
0:29:11.600" end="00:29:16.559here. And now let's continue with
0:29:14.399" end="00:29:18.480creating our OpenAI news scraper. And
0:29:16.559" end="00:29:22.399we're going to do one for Entropic as
0:29:18.480" end="00:29:25.120well. So let's come over here. And I'm
0:29:22.399" end="00:29:27.919just simply going to say, okay, awesome.
0:29:25.120" end="00:29:30.240The YouTube scraper now is looking good.
0:29:27.919" end="00:29:31.679Now, I want you to create another
0:29:30.240" end="00:29:33.679scraper, and this is going to be the
0:29:31.679" end="00:29:36.799OpenAI scraper. And we're specifically
0:29:33.679" end="00:29:39.600going to look at the uh news page, the
0:29:36.799" end="00:29:41.279news slo of the openi.com website. I
0:29:39.600" end="00:29:42.559will link it below. What I want you to
0:29:41.279" end="00:29:44.080do is I want you to go through that
0:29:42.559" end="00:29:45.760website and try and figure out the
0:29:44.080" end="00:29:48.320structure. We may need some kind of like
0:29:45.760" end="00:29:50.080intermediate file to with the request or
0:29:48.320" end="00:29:51.679beautiful soup or whatever to figure out
0:29:50.080" end="00:29:54.240what the structure of those news
0:29:51.679" end="00:29:55.840articles is and how we can easily scrape
0:29:54.240" end="00:29:57.840them and get them into a structured
0:29:55.840" end="00:29:59.840format. So, we first need to do some
0:29:57.840" end="00:30:03.600digging and and some experimentation
0:29:59.840" end="00:30:05.919here. So, let's start there.
0:30:03.600" end="00:30:08.640Okay. So, that got weird real quick and
0:30:05.919" end="00:30:10.559all of a sudden I realized, hey, wait,
0:30:08.640" end="00:30:13.360maybe there is an easier solution. And
0:30:10.559" end="00:30:16.000guess turns out there is an RSS feed for
0:30:13.360" end="00:30:18.240OpenAI as well. Look, we have everything
0:30:16.000" end="00:30:20.480that we need in here already. So,
0:30:18.240" end="00:30:22.880scraping is generally a lot easier if
0:30:20.480" end="00:30:24.559you have a single page. um that is
0:30:22.880" end="00:30:26.559generally something that we can work
0:30:24.559" end="00:30:29.919around very easy and actually know a
0:30:26.559" end="00:30:32.399very effective way to to do that. So
0:30:29.919" end="00:30:35.120yeah, I think this this works. Now we
0:30:32.399" end="00:30:37.440just need to figure out So I'm what I'm
0:30:35.120" end="00:30:39.600going to do I'm just going to give it a
0:30:37.440" end="00:30:42.240piece of the puzzle.
0:30:39.600" end="00:30:45.039So I'm going to say where are we? Okay,
0:30:42.240" end="00:30:46.640sorry. A little bit messy there. Look,
0:30:45.039" end="00:30:48.399this is going I think this is going to
0:30:46.640" end="00:30:51.120be cool. Okay, so here's a snippet of
0:30:48.399" end="00:30:53.200the RSS feed what it looks like. Boom.
0:30:51.120" end="00:30:55.120That is so don't don't you like how fast
0:30:53.200" end="00:30:58.960that is? Beautiful. Okay. Then we have
0:30:55.120" end="00:31:02.240the website. Okay. Look first within the
0:30:58.960" end="00:31:05.520OpenAI scraper use this RSS feed as an
0:31:02.240" end="00:31:07.120input and then analyze the structure and
0:31:05.520" end="00:31:09.919grab it in such a way and create a
0:31:07.120" end="00:31:14.320pyantic model around it where we can
0:31:09.919" end="00:31:17.440simply get a list of the articles
0:31:14.320" end="00:31:19.440published within a given time frame.
0:31:17.440" end="00:31:21.600Let's start there first and really do it
0:31:19.440" end="00:31:22.960clean and simple in as little code as
0:31:21.600" end="00:31:25.440possible. Ideally, this shouldn't be
0:31:22.960" end="00:31:28.320complex. So, look, now we get a
0:31:25.440" end="00:31:30.240beautiful open AI file in here, which is
0:31:28.320" end="00:31:32.080something we should be mindful of. So,
0:31:30.240" end="00:31:34.799one of big tip whenever you get into
0:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.960very weird import errors, always make
0:31:34.799" end="00:31:40.880sure that you don't accidentally have a
0:31:36.960" end="00:31:42.880file name in Python that is similar to a
0:31:40.880" end="00:31:45.360package that you're importing. So,
0:31:42.880" end="00:31:48.000having this as OpenAI
0:31:45.360" end="00:31:51.039is tricky. So, let's watch it. We're not
0:31:48.000" end="00:31:54.320importing OpenAI in this specific file.
0:31:51.039" end="00:31:56.159So, I think we should be good, but this
0:31:54.320" end="00:31:57.840this may come back and bite us in the
0:31:56.159" end="00:32:00.799ass later down the line. Okay, perfect.
0:31:57.840" end="00:32:03.440This looks good. We have Yeah, let's
0:32:00.799" end="00:32:07.840see. 24 hours. Perfect. Because now,
0:32:03.440" end="00:32:10.399let's see, we can run this. So, we have
0:32:07.840" end="00:32:12.799our OpenAI scraper.
0:32:10.399" end="00:32:14.320So, that now works. And now we can we
0:32:12.799" end="00:32:16.799say look this is going to be list of
0:32:14.320" end="00:32:18.480articles last 24 hours. So now we have
0:32:16.799" end="00:32:22.159everything print articles and we have
0:32:18.480" end="00:32:24.960nothing. Okay that's that is beautiful.
0:32:22.159" end="00:32:27.519Just to make sure oh just to make sure
0:32:24.960" end="00:32:29.600we are not
0:32:27.519" end="00:32:31.600okay okay this so this is definitely an
0:32:29.600" end="00:32:36.880hour thing
0:32:31.600" end="00:32:39.360but what's going on be okay so titles.
0:32:36.880" end="00:32:42.799So this is actually today.
0:32:39.360" end="00:32:44.960So, we have to check if the if the time
0:32:42.799" end="00:32:46.799window works.
0:32:44.960" end="00:32:48.799Please check if we're handling the dates
0:32:46.799" end="00:32:50.640correctly. If I did the last 24 hours, I
0:32:48.799" end="00:32:52.960didn't get any results. Although, I see
0:32:50.640" end="00:32:55.440results on the website. I dumped the
0:32:52.960" end="00:32:58.320first result that we get below and also
0:32:55.440" end="00:33:01.360a snippet of the XML file to check that.
0:32:58.320" end="00:33:05.120Really offloading all the thinking to to
0:33:01.360" end="00:33:06.960AI here. But yeah, that's that's what
0:33:05.120" end="00:33:08.799programming is nowadays. Now like some
0:33:06.960" end="00:33:10.559you really have to for this video I'm
0:33:08.799" end="00:33:12.640like definitely like leaning more into
0:33:10.559" end="00:33:15.919the vibe over here because it's also
0:33:12.640" end="00:33:18.159tricky to explain everything right as
0:33:15.919" end="00:33:21.039I'm going through this and then also do
0:33:18.159" end="00:33:25.440like really focused coding. is are
0:33:21.039" end="00:33:29.919we so for some reason if I try and try
0:33:25.440" end="00:33:32.320and and copy a snippet of the XML file
0:33:29.919" end="00:33:33.600it does the whole thing.
0:33:32.320" end="00:33:36.640So that's something to keep in mind. So
0:33:33.600" end="00:33:38.799I did this. So I do I do this and then
0:33:36.640" end="00:33:40.240still are there nested items in here? I
0:33:38.799" end="00:33:42.960don't think so. Right. For some reason
0:33:40.240" end="00:33:44.880it just captures everything. Let's see
0:33:42.960" end="00:33:47.760what is it saying. Checking the issues
0:33:44.880" end="00:33:50.880likely how we compare dates. The article
0:33:47.760" end="00:33:54.159from 12 is older than about Yeah.
0:33:50.880" end="00:33:57.120Checking the RSS feed.
0:33:54.159" end="00:34:00.000Am I just the newest one? Oh, this is
0:33:57.120" end="00:34:01.519Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Got it. I I
0:34:00.000" end="00:34:04.399I was looking at this, but this is the
0:34:01.519" end="00:34:06.320last build date. This literally this is
0:34:04.399" end="00:34:09.119today's date. So I think this is good. I
0:34:06.320" end="00:34:10.960think the date is there in correct.
0:34:09.119" end="00:34:14.000Yeah, more reliable. Okay, so it did
0:34:10.960" end="00:34:18.399make some changes. So when I want to get
0:34:14.000" end="00:34:21.359the when was the GPT 5.1 so that was
0:34:18.399" end="00:34:24.32012th of November. They released it at
0:34:21.359" end="00:34:26.800midnight. But then the thing is then we
0:34:24.320" end="00:34:29.200should get two, right? Wait, it's a
0:34:26.800" end="00:34:32.560list. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We
0:34:29.200" end="00:34:34.720probably have all of them in here. We We
0:34:32.560" end="00:34:37.520have four. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're good.
0:34:34.720" end="00:34:41.599We're all good because look now probably
0:34:37.520" end="00:34:45.440or most definitely. If I take index
0:34:41.599" end="00:34:48.320number one, this should be the Okay. No,
0:34:45.440" end="00:34:50.639not that one. There are more. I guess
0:34:48.320" end="00:34:56.240this and then
0:34:50.639" end="00:35:00.400GBT 5.1 OpenAI article. Perfect. Okay,
0:34:56.240" end="00:35:02.800this is good. Now what I am going to do
0:35:00.400" end="00:35:04.960and here I'm just going to I know AI can
0:35:02.800" end="00:35:07.680do this but it will probably mess it up
0:35:04.960" end="00:35:09.520first. I'm going to let's see I'm going
0:35:07.680" end="00:35:12.640to open up a terminal. I'm going to UV
0:35:09.520" end="00:35:14.320add and then I'm going to do darkling
0:35:12.640" end="00:35:16.320website.
0:35:14.320" end="00:35:19.359Let's see. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait. I
0:35:16.320" end="00:35:21.280need the docs. I need the docs. Where is
0:35:19.359" end="00:35:23.119it?
0:35:21.280" end="00:35:28.000The
0:35:23.119" end="00:35:29.200I may even just go to my AI cookbook
0:35:28.000" end="00:35:30.400here. This is this is cool. I'm
0:35:29.200" end="00:35:32.960wondering if you also get it. If you
0:35:30.400" end="00:35:35.119search for AI cookbook, at least for me,
0:35:32.960" end="00:35:36.960first you see OpenAI and then you see my
0:35:35.119" end="00:35:38.720GitHub repository. So, this is where I
0:35:36.960" end="00:35:41.599share all of my YouTube tutorials and
0:35:38.720" end="00:35:43.040also where I literally reference a whole
0:35:41.599" end="00:35:45.839lot of stuff myself when I'm working on
0:35:43.040" end="00:35:47.520things because I know that in knowledge
0:35:45.839" end="00:35:49.200dockling
0:35:47.520" end="00:35:50.800extraction
0:35:49.200" end="00:35:52.800we
0:35:50.800" end="00:35:54.800convert.
0:35:52.800" end="00:35:57.359Yeah. So, this is literally this is what
0:35:54.800" end="00:36:00.400I need and then export to markdown basic
0:35:57.359" end="00:36:02.000HTML extraction. Perfect.
0:36:00.400" end="00:36:05.040This is what I was looking for because
0:36:02.000" end="00:36:08.000now what I want is
0:36:05.040" end="00:36:10.800okay, perfect. We got the extraction
0:36:08.000" end="00:36:13.040working. Now I want to create another
0:36:10.800" end="00:36:18.320function in the service over here that's
0:36:13.040" end="00:36:20.960going to take a URL as input and then
0:36:18.320" end="00:36:22.960get the content and export it to
0:36:20.960" end="00:36:27.680markdown. Uh I'll show below how to do
0:36:22.960" end="00:36:31.920that. And then all I just want need to
0:36:27.680" end="00:36:33.440add in there is this. So, and this is
0:36:31.920" end="00:36:36.160one of those things where I could have
0:36:33.440" end="00:36:40.240said, hey, use dockling to do this, but
0:36:36.160" end="00:36:41.599whenever you already know what's how how
0:36:40.240" end="00:36:43.200something should work and what something
0:36:41.599" end="00:36:45.200should look like. It's always better to
0:36:43.200" end="00:36:47.119quickly like look that up to avoid
0:36:45.200" end="00:36:49.520getting into this rabbit hole where it's
0:36:47.119" end="00:36:52.240like almost doing what you want but not
0:36:49.520" end="00:36:55.359exactly. That can get tricky. So this is
0:36:52.240" end="00:36:58.480now look this is very very easy URL to
0:36:55.359" end="00:37:00.720markdown. We have that in there URL to
0:36:58.480" end="00:37:02.720markdown. Uh and here's the thing like
0:37:00.720" end="00:37:04.480sometimes like dockling is a little bit
0:37:02.720" end="00:37:06.720of a beefier library. So here you can
0:37:04.480" end="00:37:08.960see it takes some time to load this in
0:37:06.720" end="00:37:10.640especially if you do this the first time
0:37:08.960" end="00:37:13.520because it will it will download some
0:37:10.640" end="00:37:16.000stuff. So that's why this is taking a
0:37:13.520" end="00:37:18.800little bit longer than usual.
0:37:16.000" end="00:37:22.079But it is a really nice it is an really
0:37:18.800" end="00:37:24.640nice library to convert a web page to
0:37:22.079" end="00:37:28.800yeah to a markdown which is going to
0:37:24.640" end="00:37:31.599really help us for our AI analysis. So
0:37:28.800" end="00:37:32.960let's see. Yeah, actually I want this
0:37:31.599" end="00:37:34.880and actually I want the second.
0:37:32.960" end="00:37:37.599Beautiful. Yeah. Okay. So we have the
0:37:34.880" end="00:37:39.440articles. So we have four articles in
0:37:37.599" end="00:37:41.680here. There we go. And now we're going
0:37:39.440" end="00:37:44.720to say look I want the markdown to be
0:37:41.680" end="00:37:47.200openi markdown scraper URL to markdown.
0:37:44.720" end="00:37:52.000This is our function. We do the dockling
0:37:47.200" end="00:37:55.040convert which is we have our converter.
0:37:52.000" end="00:37:57.200Yeah. And then we do article number two.
0:37:55.040" end="00:38:00.320So you can see look article number two
0:37:57.200" end="00:38:01.839URL is this beautiful. I'm blocking this
0:38:00.320" end="00:38:03.200a little bit but you can see this is the
0:38:01.839" end="00:38:05.599actual link in here. And this is just
0:38:03.200" end="00:38:07.440one of the things where you just you
0:38:05.599" end="00:38:09.119just can't beat that with the
0:38:07.440" end="00:38:10.960interactive mode that I'm I'm working
0:38:09.119" end="00:38:13.440with to go through your files like this.
0:38:10.960" end="00:38:15.760I know a lot of people like even my my
0:38:13.440" end="00:38:17.359co-founder at Dead Luminina, Yurus, he's
0:38:15.760" end="00:38:19.440he's like an old school Python
0:38:17.359" end="00:38:21.839developer. He he loves PyCharm. He's
0:38:19.440" end="00:38:24.480like he just can't get used to how I run
0:38:21.839" end="00:38:26.960my Python scripts. But to me, like I've
0:38:24.480" end="00:38:30.640said, you you can't beat this. You can't
0:38:26.960" end="00:38:32.800beat this. So now we get the markdown.
0:38:30.640" end="00:38:35.920So we have that
0:38:32.800" end="00:38:38.640in here. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Scraper
0:38:35.920" end="00:38:41.520URL to markdown. There's Wait, wait,
0:38:38.640" end="00:38:44.720wait. Do we have something? We don't get
0:38:41.520" end="00:38:46.640anything back. What's happening?
0:38:44.720" end="00:38:48.560Okay, so I got a little bit into a
0:38:46.640" end="00:38:51.680rabbit hole there because apparently
0:38:48.560" end="00:38:53.520OpenAI is really tricky with scraping
0:38:51.680" end="00:38:55.599any information from their website. It's
0:38:53.520" end="00:38:58.160very much restricted by Cloudflare. So,
0:38:55.599" end="00:38:59.440for now, we have the RSS feed, we have
0:38:58.160" end="00:39:01.599the link, and we also have a
0:38:59.440" end="00:39:03.839description. I feel like for now, this
0:39:01.599" end="00:39:05.359is also enough for our news feed. Uh, I
0:39:03.839" end="00:39:08.079don't want to get into that rabbit hole.
0:39:05.359" end="00:39:11.119Now, Entropic doesn't have an RSS feed,
0:39:08.079" end="00:39:13.839but I found this very useful repository
0:39:11.119" end="00:39:17.839from this gentleman over here, Old
0:39:13.839" end="00:39:20.320Shanks, and pretty much he created RSets
0:39:17.839" end="00:39:24.240feeds for some very interesting, let's
0:39:20.320" end="00:39:27.119see, some interesting websites among it,
0:39:24.240" end="00:39:28.640entropic. So, I'm just like literally
0:39:27.119" end="00:39:31.920like trying to figure out how it works.
0:39:28.640" end="00:39:35.040But we need the XML files over here. So,
0:39:31.920" end="00:39:37.200the raw XML file links. So we we get the
0:39:35.040" end="00:39:40.000news, we get the engineering and we get
0:39:37.200" end="00:39:42.960the research engineering research. So
0:39:40.000" end="00:39:45.839I'm just trying to get all of that and
0:39:42.960" end="00:39:48.320then let's say okay look there are three
0:39:45.839" end="00:39:50.160feeds for entropic. Can you combine them
0:39:48.320" end="00:39:52.240in a single entropic scraper that every
0:39:50.160" end="00:39:54.480time we run it we just consider all of
0:39:52.240" end="00:39:57.040these feeds and we process process them
0:39:54.480" end="00:40:00.560in the same way? Let's check this out.
0:39:57.040" end="00:40:02.320So we're now building a similar type of
0:40:00.560" end="00:40:05.359scraper similar to what we saw over
0:40:02.320" end="00:40:08.720here. So we have the open AI one where
0:40:05.359" end="00:40:10.640actually we're not going to work with
0:40:08.720" end="00:40:13.119this because this is this is not working
0:40:10.640" end="00:40:15.119unfortunately right now. So for now
0:40:13.119" end="00:40:17.680we're just going to get the articles
0:40:15.119" end="00:40:20.160which is good [clears throat] and let's
0:40:17.680" end="00:40:22.560actually have a look at what this looks
0:40:20.160" end="00:40:25.200like. So now I'm going to do an ifn name
0:40:22.560" end="00:40:28.400main scraper.
0:40:25.200" end="00:40:31.119Let's see top results in the last seven
0:40:28.400" end="00:40:33.040days. We have three articles.
0:40:31.119" end="00:40:36.160So, let's see what that looks like. So,
0:40:33.040" end="00:40:38.480we have our scraper. Let's do let's get
0:40:36.160" end="00:40:42.400the articles. Let's print the articles.
0:40:38.480" end="00:40:44.560Here's two. Let's make it 100. We still
0:40:42.400" end="00:40:46.960have two two articles. Or is it more?
0:40:44.560" end="00:40:50.000How how many articles is it from? When
0:40:46.960" end="00:40:52.000is this? Okay, this is very recent. So,
0:40:50.000" end="00:40:55.040this is this is good. We're getting the
0:40:52.000" end="00:40:56.640information. Yes. Let's see. We just
0:40:55.040" end="00:40:58.560have we have a title and we have the
0:40:56.640" end="00:41:00.720description. Okay. So, now let's
0:40:58.560" end="00:41:04.240actually have a look. I I don't think
0:41:00.720" end="00:41:07.680Entropic will let us do this either, but
0:41:04.240" end="00:41:12.880let's just have a quick look to see,
0:41:07.680" end="00:41:15.760hey, can we do this or is that not
0:41:12.880" end="00:41:20.000allowed from? Let's just do it in from
0:41:15.760" end="00:41:22.720dockling in import document converter.
0:41:20.000" end="00:41:25.839Yes, we get a document converter. And
0:41:22.720" end="00:41:28.720will this work? Oh, I think I think
0:41:25.839" end="00:41:32.560actually Entropic allows allows us to do
0:41:28.720" end="00:41:35.119it. We have the document to markdown.
0:41:32.560" end="00:41:37.119Entropic is fine with that. That is
0:41:35.119" end="00:41:39.359cool. Okay.
0:41:37.119" end="00:41:42.319Beautiful. Let's come back over here.
0:41:39.359" end="00:41:45.119Okay. Entropic is actually fine with
0:41:42.319" end="00:41:47.920getting the context of the pages with
0:41:45.119" end="00:41:50.960darkling. Can you add the function to
0:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.640the Can you add the function to the
0:41:50.960" end="00:41:55.040class as well? Similar to how we did
0:41:52.640" end="00:41:57.440with OpenAI. Keep it very lean. I have a
0:41:55.040" end="00:42:00.480example snippet below the file. All
0:41:57.440" end="00:42:02.720right. And then we lean back again. A
0:42:00.480" end="00:42:04.640little bit of a stretch in here. Make
0:42:02.720" end="00:42:06.720sure to keep moving, guys, in these long
0:42:04.640" end="00:42:09.680coding sessions.
0:42:06.720" end="00:42:12.800There we go. Okay, let's see what it is
0:42:09.680" end="00:42:15.760coming up with. It's going to create the
0:42:12.800" end="00:42:17.040converter. And we have that in here. Oh,
0:42:15.760" end="00:42:19.920wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't like
0:42:17.040" end="00:42:21.280this. Don't like this. Get articles.
0:42:19.920" end="00:42:25.119Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. This is
0:42:21.280" end="00:42:28.000good. But I still want this. Yes.
0:42:25.119" end="00:42:30.160Scraper articles.
0:42:28.000" end="00:42:32.400Article number two. What is that going
0:42:30.160" end="00:42:35.040to be? URL
0:42:32.400" end="00:42:39.440list out of range. What we got? We only
0:42:35.040" end="00:42:42.720have two. So we need we need this URL.
0:42:39.440" end="00:42:46.560Project fetch robot dog. What is this?
0:42:42.720" end="00:42:50.319Okay, there we go. And we have project.
0:42:46.560" end="00:42:53.280Okay, so that is cool. What is this
0:42:50.319" end="00:42:54.880project fetch robot do? Well, now you
0:42:53.280" end="00:42:58.480know. Otherwise, I would have never
0:42:54.880" end="00:43:00.720found this project. Seems pretty cool.
0:42:58.480" end="00:43:02.560All right, but we're making we're making
0:43:00.720" end="00:43:04.560great we're making great moves here. So,
0:43:02.560" end="00:43:06.000we got our scrapers because remember in
0:43:04.560" end="00:43:07.920the beginning I said, &quot;Look, I want
0:43:06.000" end="00:43:10.000YouTube, I want OpenAI, and I want
0:43:07.920" end="00:43:13.680Entropic in there.&quot; Now, it's actually
0:43:10.000" end="00:43:17.200time to start to create a pipeline
0:43:13.680" end="00:43:19.920around this. So, we can pretty much get
0:43:17.200" end="00:43:21.440all of this and then I want to get it
0:43:19.920" end="00:43:24.160into a database. So, that's what we're
0:43:21.440" end="00:43:28.240going to focus on next. Okay. So, let's
0:43:24.160" end="00:43:30.480come back to our agent one more time and
0:43:28.240" end="00:43:33.040let's see if I already now I don't want
0:43:30.480" end="00:43:35.520to reset the context just yet. So, what
0:43:33.040" end="00:43:38.319we're going to do Okay, so now we got
0:43:35.520" end="00:43:41.119the core scrapers in place. We got
0:43:38.319" end="00:43:44.960YouTube, we got Entropic, and we got
0:43:41.119" end="00:43:48.640OpenAI. Now what I want you to do is I
0:43:44.960" end="00:43:51.359want you to create some kind of like
0:43:48.640" end="00:43:53.920runner that brings everything together
0:43:51.359" end="00:43:56.240where we can first of all look oh
0:43:53.920" end="00:43:58.880there's one more thing we need someplace
0:43:56.240" end="00:44:00.640to store which channels YouTube channels
0:43:58.880" end="00:44:03.200we want to monitor. you can keep it very
0:44:00.640" end="00:44:05.680simple for now and that we should store
0:44:03.200" end="00:44:08.000that somewhere and then for entropic and
0:44:05.680" end="00:44:09.760for openi the it's always the same the
0:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.839input and then we want to create some
0:44:09.760" end="00:44:14.319kind of like function where we can kick
0:44:11.839" end="00:44:16.560off this process and then also identify
0:44:14.319" end="00:44:19.280how how far we want to go back and
0:44:16.560" end="00:44:21.359ideally we want to set it to 24 uh hours
0:44:19.280" end="00:44:22.720in the beginning where do we place that
0:44:21.359" end="00:44:25.280and what would that look like try and
0:44:22.720" end="00:44:27.200keep it as simple as possible
0:44:25.280" end="00:44:29.280okay so this is always interesting to
0:44:27.200" end="00:44:33.200see what it will now come up with right
0:44:29.280" end="00:44:35.680So I am assuming it will create like I
0:44:33.200" end="00:44:38.240hope so in the app folder we will get
0:44:35.680" end="00:44:41.920some kind of like a runnerpy
0:44:38.240" end="00:44:43.440or anything like that. So let's see what
0:44:41.920" end="00:44:47.520it come with what what it will come up
0:44:43.440" end="00:44:49.280with. So we have we have a config we
0:44:47.520" end="00:44:51.440have the YouTube channels. Okay. So
0:44:49.280" end="00:44:53.280that's that's okay. It's okay for now.
0:44:51.440" end="00:44:54.720In here
0:44:53.280" end="00:44:57.119we [clears throat] have the runner.
0:44:54.720" end="00:44:58.960That's also okay. Yeah we don't want
0:44:57.119" end="00:45:02.319that app in here.
0:44:58.960" end="00:45:04.240We want scrapers. Yes.
0:45:02.319" end="00:45:08.000What is it doing? It's creating a
0:45:04.240" end="00:45:10.480main.py outside of the app folder. Okay.
0:45:08.000" end="00:45:11.839Is that okay? This that can be the
0:45:10.480" end="00:45:13.920interface for now. That can be the
0:45:11.839" end="00:45:15.680interface. Okay. We get the results.
0:45:13.920" end="00:45:19.839Import.
0:45:15.680" end="00:45:22.000Yeah. Okay. We get the results. Okay.
0:45:19.839" end="00:45:25.440Beautiful. So now what I want to do is
0:45:22.000" end="00:45:28.160instead of using my own channel, I
0:45:25.440" end="00:45:31.440actually want to experiment with Mr.
0:45:28.160" end="00:45:33.680Matthew Berman, which is an excellent
0:45:31.440" end="00:45:35.920sore because he's like always on fire
0:45:33.680" end="00:45:38.800with the latest the latest news. So
0:45:35.920" end="00:45:40.319let's actually get his YouTube channel
0:45:38.800" end="00:45:42.480ID.
0:45:40.319" end="00:45:44.560Let's see there.
0:45:42.480" end="00:45:46.880Maybe there's What am I doing?
0:45:44.560" end="00:45:50.560There's probably a way better [laughter]
0:45:46.880" end="00:45:53.520method to do this, but for now it works.
0:45:50.560" end="00:45:56.800So, if you're following along, you What?
0:45:53.520" end="00:45:59.680No, we reached the daily limit. Oh,
0:45:56.800" end="00:46:03.280really? Is there another website? Find
0:45:59.680" end="00:46:07.040YouTube. So, this is definitely not not
0:46:03.280" end="00:46:09.040ideal. So, where are we? Let's give me
0:46:07.040" end="00:46:11.359the channel name. So, you probably want
0:46:09.040" end="00:46:14.000to set up the YouTube API for that. Oh,
0:46:11.359" end="00:46:15.359we need to solve this. Yeah. Watch ad.
0:46:14.000" end="00:46:18.160Oh, [laughter]
0:46:15.359" end="00:46:20.480this is this is horrible. Oh, we got it.
0:46:18.160" end="00:46:23.920We got the channel ID. Perfect. Now,
0:46:20.480" end="00:46:28.079also, let's just actually So, this is
0:46:23.920" end="00:46:32.480this is this is Dave. And let's just put
0:46:28.079" end="00:46:34.720this in here. And just so we don't this
0:46:32.480" end="00:46:37.280is not Scottman
0:46:34.720" end="00:46:39.359or whatever that is. This is Matthew
0:46:37.280" end="00:46:40.960Burman. Make sure to get get your name
0:46:39.359" end="00:46:43.920right, buddy. [snorts]
0:46:40.960" end="00:46:46.560Cool. Okay, so we got the channel. Now,
0:46:43.920" end="00:46:48.079let's see if I like let's see if I like
0:46:46.560" end="00:46:51.119what's going on over here. So, we
0:46:48.079" end="00:46:53.680initialize the YouTube scraper, open
0:46:51.119" end="00:46:57.040eye, and tropic. And we got all of that.
0:46:53.680" end="00:46:59.440We're going to fetch the YouTube videos,
0:46:57.040" end="00:47:03.040and we're going to extend the list.
0:46:59.440" end="00:47:05.119Okay, so that's great. Yeah.
0:47:03.040" end="00:47:09.920Get latest video. Do we do the scraping
0:47:05.119" end="00:47:11.280in there? Feed parser.
0:47:09.920" end="00:47:12.480Yes.
0:47:11.280" end="00:47:14.800So, we're not I don't think we're
0:47:12.480" end="00:47:16.800getting the transcripts in here. Why am
0:47:14.800" end="00:47:18.400I typing? And do we already want to get
0:47:16.800" end="00:47:20.240those or do we want to get that in a
0:47:18.400" end="00:47:21.760later stage where first we just get all
0:47:20.240" end="00:47:23.520of the items, store that into a
0:47:21.760" end="00:47:25.680database, and then later trigger the
0:47:23.520" end="00:47:27.440processing?
0:47:25.680" end="00:47:29.200I'm now I'm just going to ask this
0:47:27.440" end="00:47:32.079because this is more of an architectural
0:47:29.200" end="00:47:35.040decision where I'm thinking about what
0:47:32.079" end="00:47:36.960makes more sense. Yeah. So, I think this
0:47:35.040" end="00:47:39.280is this is cleaner recommendation,
0:47:36.960" end="00:47:41.200two-stage approach. one store metadata
0:47:39.280" end="00:47:43.359no transfer fast get all the items and
0:47:41.200" end="00:47:46.640then process. So this can also be done
0:47:43.359" end="00:47:48.480in the background to process. Okay.
0:47:46.640" end="00:47:50.960Okay. Perfect. Let's let's let's do it
0:47:48.480" end="00:47:53.839like this. This is totally fine. So it
0:47:50.960" end="00:47:55.680returns everything. So now we go on to
0:47:53.839" end="00:47:57.680the next step.
0:47:55.680" end="00:48:00.400This is going to be a big one. So I want
0:47:57.680" end="00:48:02.880to make sure that we check in or commit
0:48:00.400" end="00:48:05.599everything over here. So we can start
0:48:02.880" end="00:48:07.359with the clean slate. Let's let AI come
0:48:05.599" end="00:48:10.079up with a beautiful commit message over
0:48:07.359" end="00:48:12.640here. Okay. So, what I want to do next
0:48:10.079" end="00:48:14.400is I first want to set up the foundation
0:48:12.640" end="00:48:16.480for the database. So, what I want you to
0:48:14.400" end="00:48:20.079do is I want you to create a simple
0:48:16.480" end="00:48:23.040docker compose file with
0:48:20.079" end="00:48:25.760just a Postgres SQL database. You can
0:48:23.040" end="00:48:28.240come up with all of the default
0:48:25.760" end="00:48:30.319usernames and passwords for it. Make
0:48:28.240" end="00:48:32.480sure to create an
0:48:30.319" end="00:48:37.200example.environment.env
0:48:32.480" end="00:48:41.200ENV kind of like file for that. And
0:48:37.200" end="00:48:44.240also in the app folder create a database
0:48:41.200" end="00:48:48.079folder where we are going to create the
0:48:44.240" end="00:48:51.119SQL alchemy database models. And then we
0:48:48.079" end="00:48:53.599create a single script called create
0:48:51.119" end="00:48:55.680tables to initialize all of the tables.
0:48:53.599" end="00:48:57.680And I also want you to create a simple
0:48:55.680" end="00:49:00.160CRUD interface or repository whatever
0:48:57.680" end="00:49:03.119you want to call it to interact with the
0:49:00.160" end="00:49:05.200database. As you go and do that, then I
0:49:03.119" end="00:49:07.680will try and run the Docker container.
0:49:05.200" end="00:49:10.000So we can set it up connect locally and
0:49:07.680" end="00:49:12.000then make sure that we can create the
0:49:10.000" end="00:49:14.559tables and then test if we can actually
0:49:12.000" end="00:49:16.800get the YouTube videos and the OpenAI
0:49:14.559" end="00:49:20.160articles and entropic articles in there.
0:49:16.800" end="00:49:23.520And then I also want you to adjust the
0:49:20.160" end="00:49:25.440runner. So the run scrapers to not just
0:49:23.520" end="00:49:27.760get the articles but we need to put them
0:49:25.440" end="00:49:30.480into the database.
0:49:27.760" end="00:49:33.920This is a big one. This is a big one.
0:49:30.480" end="00:49:36.160And you can also see like right now how
0:49:33.920" end="00:49:38.000important it is to understand the
0:49:36.160" end="00:49:40.000process. Right? I've done this many
0:49:38.000" end="00:49:43.040times already before. So I can give very
0:49:40.000" end="00:49:46.559clear instructions as to I want a docker
0:49:43.040" end="00:49:49.440compos file. I want SQL Alchemy database
0:49:46.559" end="00:49:52.640models. So, and I I understand that I
0:49:49.440" end="00:49:55.359now need to wait. This needs to be in
0:49:52.640" end="00:49:57.680the Docker folder. Let's see.
0:49:55.359" end="00:50:00.000Env.example. Okay, it's creating all of
0:49:57.680" end="00:50:05.119that stuff. So, let's actually move this
0:50:00.000" end="00:50:08.960to docker. Let's see. Env.acample.
0:50:05.119" end="00:50:11.040We can also for now plug that in here.
0:50:08.960" end="00:50:13.359Example.env.
0:50:11.040" end="00:50:16.160That's That's the correct syntax. Oh,
0:50:13.359" end="00:50:18.720and then of course we need to spell that
0:50:16.160" end="00:50:21.200correctly. So we have that in here. We
0:50:18.720" end="00:50:22.800have Okay, so this is do this is doing a
0:50:21.200" end="00:50:25.520lot of stuff. Okay, we have Docker
0:50:22.800" end="00:50:27.359compose. Let's see. This is all like old
0:50:25.520" end="00:50:30.559stuff. We don't need it anymore. So
0:50:27.359" end="00:50:32.800let's There's actually a version. Let's
0:50:30.559" end="00:50:34.559see what's this. We do a volume. We do a
0:50:32.800" end="00:50:37.680health check. Okay, that all makes
0:50:34.559" end="00:50:42.720sense. We do. Yeah. So now let's see if
0:50:37.680" end="00:50:45.599Docker is running on our machine while
0:50:42.720" end="00:50:50.160this is still going at it. Okay,
0:50:45.599" end="00:50:53.280starting up Docker. Now we need to first
0:50:50.160" end="00:50:55.920of all check if this all works. So let's
0:50:53.280" end="00:50:57.839see because this can always be really
0:50:55.920" end="00:50:59.520tricky. Like I said, for the main
0:50:57.839" end="00:51:01.680project that we're working on at Datal
0:50:59.520" end="00:51:03.119Luminina, we always use our Genai
0:51:01.680" end="00:51:03.760Launchpad. So if you go to
0:51:03.119" end="00:51:06.160launchpad.dataluminina.com,
0:51:03.760" end="00:51:10.559dataluminina.com you can find more about
0:51:06.160" end="00:51:12.400this. So this is actually a product that
0:51:10.559" end="00:51:14.000we offer. So this is not completely like
0:51:12.400" end="00:51:16.559open source and free to use but this is
0:51:14.000" end="00:51:19.040our production boilerplate that we use
0:51:16.559" end="00:51:21.119for all of our production builds really.
0:51:19.040" end="00:51:22.559And it takes care of not only like how
0:51:21.119" end="00:51:24.160do you set up your project and how do
0:51:22.559" end="00:51:25.760you define your agents and work with
0:51:24.160" end="00:51:28.400that but it also takes care of this
0:51:25.760" end="00:51:30.079little or little of this like annoying
0:51:28.400" end="00:51:31.599infrastructure setup that we're now
0:51:30.079" end="00:51:33.920going to deal with because this can get
0:51:31.599" end="00:51:35.440really tricky to configure everything
0:51:33.920" end="00:51:37.920correctly. So now what I'm just going to
0:51:35.440" end="00:51:39.599do I'm going to do docker compose AI
0:51:37.920" end="00:51:43.200always gives it with a dash but that's
0:51:39.599" end="00:51:46.000outdated. Docker compose up and let's
0:51:43.200" end="00:51:47.520run it in a detach mode to see if this
0:51:46.000" end="00:51:51.119actually runs. It's going to pull
0:51:47.520" end="00:51:52.960Postgress right now and just a Postgress
0:51:51.119" end="00:51:55.76017 instance. If you've never worked with
0:51:52.960" end="00:51:58.480Docker before, you might want to do a
0:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.920quick check to a tutorial on how this
0:51:58.480" end="00:52:02.640all works because otherwise this can
0:51:59.920" end="00:52:05.839feel like magic. But now you can see we
0:52:02.640" end="00:52:09.040have our AI news aggregator running. And
0:52:05.839" end="00:52:11.440then what I just need to do is let's
0:52:09.040" end="00:52:14.640see, we have our setup in here. And I'm
0:52:11.440" end="00:52:17.119going to open up table plus which is a
0:52:14.640" end="00:52:20.000database guey that I like to use. You
0:52:17.119" end="00:52:23.680can use anything really that you want.
0:52:20.000" end="00:52:25.680So let's see local I'm going to like do
0:52:23.680" end="00:52:27.119a new connection. I think if we can also
0:52:25.680" end="00:52:30.079just do local host I think that should
0:52:27.119" end="00:52:32.960be fine. We have the default port right
0:52:30.079" end="00:52:35.440and then let's see what usernames we the
0:52:32.960" end="00:52:37.599AI came up with. So we have user is
0:52:35.440" end="00:52:39.680going to be
0:52:37.599" end="00:52:42.160Postgress password is going to be
0:52:39.680" end="00:52:46.079Postgress and the database is going to
0:52:42.160" end="00:52:49.520be AI news aggregator and then let's see
0:52:46.079" end="00:52:51.520if this connects I think this connects.
0:52:49.520" end="00:52:53.839So we are connected right now. So that's
0:52:51.520" end="00:52:55.920all looking good. So quick note what
0:52:53.839" end="00:52:57.440we're doing we created a docker compos
0:52:55.920" end="00:53:00.559file where we say look we want to take
0:52:57.440" end="00:53:03.680the Postgress 17 docker image. So if you
0:53:00.559" end="00:53:05.359just like oh if you look that up you can
0:53:03.680" end="00:53:07.599find that if you go to the docker hub
0:53:05.359" end="00:53:10.079postgress official here you can find the
0:53:07.599" end="00:53:13.280official docker images by now there's
0:53:10.079" end="00:53:15.599already 18 in there 17 will do just fine
0:53:13.280" end="00:53:17.359that's running now locally inside the
0:53:15.599" end="00:53:19.839docker container and we exposed that
0:53:17.359" end="00:53:21.839through local host using the credentials
0:53:19.839" end="00:53:24.720that we've specified over here so that's
0:53:21.839" end="00:53:27.599why I can now connect it to it locally
0:53:24.720" end="00:53:32.319using table plus so that's how that is
0:53:27.599" end="00:53:37.040working so let's click clear that up and
0:53:32.319" end="00:53:40.480see where we are at because some
0:53:37.040" end="00:53:44.559let's see for some things it did it
0:53:40.480" end="00:53:47.359didn't listen completely so oh wait we
0:53:44.559" end="00:53:49.680have create tables what's this create
0:53:47.359" end="00:53:51.599tables
0:53:49.680" end="00:53:55.520let's just keep all of this I don't want
0:53:51.599" end="00:53:58.559this in here and I want the docker stuff
0:53:55.520" end="00:54:01.920in here did it make any changes we can
0:53:58.559" end="00:54:05.760get rid of this the env.example example
0:54:01.920" end="00:54:09.359I pro do I need this postcrist users
0:54:05.760" end="00:54:12.240just trying to see where it got the
0:54:09.359" end="00:54:14.319where it actually got the it says is
0:54:12.240" end="00:54:16.160this setting a default value okay yeah
0:54:14.319" end="00:54:19.839yeah got it because like I've said it's
0:54:16.160" end="00:54:22.839not reading it's not using this example
0:54:19.839" end="00:54:22.839enviring
0:54:26.319" end="00:54:30.079here this is always a little bit tricky
0:54:28.160" end="00:54:32.720to get right but now what we want to do
0:54:30.079" end="00:54:34.480we also asked it to. So we did a lot of
0:54:32.720" end="00:54:38.240stuff. So if we go to in here, you can
0:54:34.480" end="00:54:41.680see it adjusted the runner. So in here
0:54:38.240" end="00:54:44.720now it also has the Yeah. Okay. A lot of
0:54:41.680" end="00:54:46.960stuff. So we first ask it to create the
0:54:44.720" end="00:54:50.400models. So we can come in here. Look,
0:54:46.960" end="00:54:53.119this is now using SQL alchemy which
0:54:50.400" end="00:54:56.079should already be part of our markdown.
0:54:53.119" end="00:54:57.359I have no why is it in this in here? Not
0:54:56.079" end="00:55:00.160sure why we need it. We need to check
0:54:57.359" end="00:55:03.359that later. So we have SQL alchemy.
0:55:00.160" end="00:55:05.359Okay, that's in here. We created the
0:55:03.359" end="00:55:08.000let's see, we created the database
0:55:05.359" end="00:55:09.839tables in here. So, this is going to
0:55:08.000" end="00:55:11.599create tables where is we're going to
0:55:09.839" end="00:55:14.079have YouTube videos, OpenAI articles,
0:55:11.599" end="00:55:15.599and tropical articles. And these are
0:55:14.079" end="00:55:17.200going to be separate tables. Later down
0:55:15.599" end="00:55:19.040the line, I I think this makes sense for
0:55:17.200" end="00:55:22.800now. We could even like standardize
0:55:19.040" end="00:55:24.880this, but for now, this will work. And
0:55:22.800" end="00:55:26.640because we do this, let's see, we have a
0:55:24.880" end="00:55:28.800repository in here, which we can use to
0:55:26.640" end="00:55:31.359interact with all of the tables. And we
0:55:28.800" end="00:55:33.440have a connection look. And now here,
0:55:31.359" end="00:55:36.319this is where we're going to need to
0:55:33.440" end="00:55:39.760make a copy of our
0:55:36.319" end="00:55:42.960example. ENV and create the actual env
0:55:39.760" end="00:55:46.240because this the config uh sorry the
0:55:42.960" end="00:55:48.079database connection is going to use
0:55:46.240" end="00:55:50.640this. So this is how it's going to get
0:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.640the database URL. It's going to create
0:55:50.640" end="00:55:54.559the engine and then here to create
0:55:52.640" end="00:55:59.200tables. What this what this is going to
0:55:54.559" end="00:56:02.319do it's going to look into it's going to
0:55:59.200" end="00:56:04.720use the engine to create all and this is
0:56:02.319" end="00:56:06.480like why SQL alchemy is so nice we can
0:56:04.720" end="00:56:08.559just run this and the table should be
0:56:06.480" end="00:56:11.359successfully created so what we can now
0:56:08.559" end="00:56:15.200do we need to start this and now we can
0:56:11.359" end="00:56:17.359do u run python create tables and let's
0:56:15.200" end="00:56:19.760see this is then always tricky because
0:56:17.359" end="00:56:24.079there was a file I'm just going to
0:56:19.760" end="00:56:26.559double check that to see Look. No. What?
0:56:24.079" end="00:56:29.280I'm just going to run this. I'm just
0:56:26.559" end="00:56:30.559going to run this because we could we
0:56:29.280" end="00:56:32.319could probably even do it here because
0:56:30.559" end="00:56:34.880this is probably this is always this.
0:56:32.319" end="00:56:36.799Yeah, exactly. So now you get the the
0:56:34.880" end="00:56:39.359import errors, right, that we're getting
0:56:36.799" end="00:56:41.680over here. So now if we just get rid of
0:56:39.359" end="00:56:43.119this because we're over here. Let's
0:56:41.680" end="00:56:46.480actually Yeah, this this is the more
0:56:43.119" end="00:56:49.200proper way to do it. So
0:56:46.480" end="00:56:52.559yeah, so run it directly.
0:56:49.200" end="00:56:55.359This this this should probably be it.
0:56:52.559" end="00:56:57.680Let's have a look at what this is doing.
0:56:55.359" end="00:57:00.240Tables created successfully. Okay, let's
0:56:57.680" end="00:57:03.680come over here. Refresh this. YouTube
0:57:00.240" end="00:57:07.359videos title. Yes. Okay, this is
0:57:03.680" end="00:57:11.680perfect. Okay, so what did we just do?
0:57:07.359" end="00:57:13.200What we just did is we first of all when
0:57:11.680" end="00:57:16.400we go through this and when we have
0:57:13.200" end="00:57:18.559annoying Python being whiny about import
0:57:16.400" end="00:57:21.040p import paths what what we can always
0:57:18.559" end="00:57:22.799do is you can import cis and path and
0:57:21.040" end="00:57:24.960then you can do you can do the following
0:57:22.799" end="00:57:28.079you you can take the path from the file
0:57:24.960" end="00:57:30.160look which is it will then say look this
0:57:28.079" end="00:57:32.079is the current file that we're in and
0:57:30.160" end="00:57:34.480then because we're using the path
0:57:32.079" end="00:57:36.480library what you can do is you can do
0:57:34.480" end="00:57:38.640you can call parent on this and then
0:57:36.480" end="00:57:40.640depending how deep nested you are. So
0:57:38.640" end="00:57:42.559we're in database, then we can go in app
0:57:40.640" end="00:57:45.680and then we go into the root. Then we
0:57:42.559" end="00:57:48.160just that means we have to call parent
0:57:45.680" end="00:57:50.400three times and then if you come in
0:57:48.160" end="00:57:52.799here, can you see this? Yeah. Then we go
0:57:50.400" end="00:57:55.280to the root of the project and then from
0:57:52.799" end="00:57:57.520there we can do an import one more time
0:57:55.280" end="00:57:59.280where we say look now we know that we
0:57:57.520" end="00:58:02.400are in the root of the or the root of
0:57:59.280" end="00:58:04.880the project has been added to the path
0:58:02.400" end="00:58:07.119and Python can look into that. So now if
0:58:04.880" end="00:58:10.559you do app database models, it
0:58:07.119" end="00:58:13.280understands app database models and it
0:58:10.559" end="00:58:15.359can import that. It's just one of those
0:58:13.280" end="00:58:17.119things where
0:58:15.359" end="00:58:19.280at least for me, I've been working with
0:58:17.119" end="00:58:22.720this language for over 10 years and this
0:58:19.280" end="00:58:24.960still like messes me up a lot of the
0:58:22.720" end="00:58:26.880times, but it worked. We have created
0:58:24.960" end="00:58:29.599the tables and now the tables are
0:58:26.880" end="00:58:32.000exactly the same as how they are
0:58:29.599" end="00:58:33.760specified over here. So that's the
0:58:32.000" end="00:58:36.559beauty of using something like SQL
0:58:33.760" end="00:58:38.400Alchemy where we don't have to mess with
0:58:36.559" end="00:58:41.440actual SQL and we can do everything
0:58:38.400" end="00:58:43.839Python based and now all of the the so
0:58:41.440" end="00:58:46.000if I could go in here and let's see how
0:58:43.839" end="00:58:47.599do I do this open the structure so look
0:58:46.000" end="00:58:50.720you can see it has the correct data
0:58:47.599" end="00:58:52.799types so that is beautiful okay so now
0:58:50.720" end="00:58:55.280we have that the connection is working
0:58:52.799" end="00:58:56.880everything is working make sure whenever
0:58:55.280" end="00:58:58.799you're working with it this should be
0:58:56.880" end="00:59:02.000running so this should be this should be
0:58:58.799" end="00:59:03.920green in here if you get any errors or
0:59:02.000" end="00:59:05.760something like a port is not working.
0:59:03.920" end="00:59:10.400Make sure you have nothing else running.
0:59:05.760" end="00:59:13.040Some applications may override that. So
0:59:10.400" end="00:59:15.599now let's come back to the runner and
0:59:13.040" end="00:59:17.599see what we're doing. So now you see
0:59:15.599" end="00:59:20.799instead of just getting the videos, it's
0:59:17.599" end="00:59:25.040now creating the data models that is it
0:59:20.799" end="00:59:28.160that it is expecting. So let's see.
0:59:25.040" end="00:59:29.520Yeah, I think we for now this works. We
0:59:28.160" end="00:59:31.440can I think we could later down the line
0:59:29.520" end="00:59:33.119we could make this a little bit cleaner
0:59:31.440" end="00:59:34.640because I don't really like this this
0:59:33.119" end="00:59:36.960dictionary structure in here which is
0:59:34.640" end="00:59:39.839not really type safe. Very easy to make
0:59:36.960" end="00:59:42.000mistakes. But now if we have the runner
0:59:39.839" end="00:59:46.559we can run the scraper and it will go
0:59:42.000" end="00:59:49.520through YouTube and in YouTube it will
0:59:46.559" end="00:59:52.000go through our channel YouTube channels
0:59:49.520" end="00:59:56.799which we for now have just identified
0:59:52.000" end="00:59:58.400our boy Matthew and this should work.
0:59:56.799" end="01:00:00.400This should work. And we have the
0:59:58.400" end="01:00:02.799main.pay. So, we can either run it from
1:00:00.400" end="01:00:04.559here, but for now, let's just let's just
1:00:02.799" end="01:00:08.000run it in here. Let's see. I want to see
1:00:04.559" end="01:00:11.680the examples show up in here. So, let's
1:00:08.000" end="01:00:14.079let's give it a spin. Um, let's see.
1:00:11.680" end="01:00:16.079What do we have in here? We have we're
1:00:14.079" end="01:00:19.280doing we're running it like this. You
1:00:16.079" end="01:00:20.640know what? Actually, to make sure
1:00:19.280" end="01:00:22.160don't have to worry about all of those
1:00:20.640" end="01:00:24.319imports, I think it's better to just run
1:00:22.160" end="01:00:27.520it from here.
1:00:24.319" end="01:00:29.920And still we might run into the errors.
1:00:27.520" end="01:00:32.880But let's have a look.
1:00:29.920" end="01:00:34.640There we go. Okay. This is the what?
1:00:32.880" end="01:00:37.760Yeah. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. This is
1:00:34.640" end="01:00:39.520set up to run in the terminal using a
1:00:37.760" end="01:00:41.839legacy. We actually need to run this
1:00:39.520" end="01:00:45.200properly because it's going to ask us is
1:00:41.839" end="01:00:47.599it is it running? There we go. Yeah,
1:00:45.200" end="01:00:51.280it's it's going to check for a for an
1:00:47.599" end="01:00:53.839argument. So we got one YouTube video,
1:00:51.280" end="01:00:56.400zero OpenAI articles, zero entropic
1:00:53.839" end="01:00:58.000articles. Okay, but this is start. Let's
1:00:56.400" end="01:00:59.599come back over here. So this should
1:00:58.000" end="01:01:02.880still be empty. This should be empty.
1:00:59.599" end="01:01:06.000And then we should have Mr. Matthew over
1:01:02.880" end="01:01:09.440here who uploaded a video. Let's see
1:01:06.000" end="01:01:11.680where's the URL in the last 24 hours. So
1:01:09.440" end="01:01:13.839now we we have the Do we have the title?
1:01:11.680" end="01:01:15.680Yes. Is this the end of the AI bubble? I
1:01:13.839" end="01:01:18.720think we already saw that, right? So
1:01:15.680" end="01:01:21.280this is a fresh video.
1:01:18.720" end="01:01:23.35919 hours ago. Okay, so the math is
1:01:21.280" end="01:01:26.720working. I love this. I love this. Okay,
1:01:23.359" end="01:01:30.240so now let's check. Do we have We have a
1:01:26.720" end="01:01:33.839video ID. Is this Now what I want to
1:01:30.240" end="01:01:35.440check if I run this one more time, will
1:01:33.839" end="01:01:38.559it
1:01:35.440" end="01:01:40.079will it overwrite it or add it give an
1:01:38.559" end="01:01:42.319error because we don't want to have
1:01:40.079" end="01:01:46.079duplicate data in there. So let's run
1:01:42.319" end="01:01:48.160this one more time, I think. Okay, this
1:01:46.079" end="01:01:51.280is good. there's no duplicate data. So
1:01:48.160" end="01:01:54.640then we can check that by coming to our
1:01:51.280" end="01:01:57.599database models to see okay look what is
1:01:54.640" end="01:02:01.760how is this working. So for YouTube we
1:01:57.599" end="01:02:04.000have our video ID is the primary key. So
1:02:01.760" end="01:02:06.880and whenever you set a primary key
1:02:04.000" end="01:02:08.880within a database you cannot have
1:02:06.880" end="01:02:12.480another primary key so that it it will
1:02:08.880" end="01:02:15.599override it. So but let's let's actually
1:02:12.480" end="01:02:18.000check how that is implemented.
1:02:15.599" end="01:02:21.599Okay, beautiful. This is working. How is
1:02:18.000" end="01:02:24.640the avoiding duplicate data implemented?
1:02:21.599" end="01:02:27.599I see there are primary keys in there
1:02:24.640" end="01:02:29.920and it's totally fine to to first just
1:02:27.599" end="01:02:32.079extract all of the videos for the past
1:02:29.920" end="01:02:34.07924 hours. But then when we want to push
1:02:32.079" end="01:02:37.680it to the database it whenever there is
1:02:34.079" end="01:02:42.319a a new I think let's let's say whenever
1:02:37.680" end="01:02:44.880there is a new a similar ID we want to
1:02:42.319" end="01:02:46.880do we want to override it
1:02:44.880" end="01:02:49.280no we don't then we just want to skip it
1:02:46.880" end="01:02:51.119we don't want to override it
1:02:49.280" end="01:02:53.280that's an architectural decision for now
1:02:51.119" end="01:02:55.920I'm not sure if that is the best case
1:02:53.280" end="01:02:58.160because is it the thing is this is just
1:02:55.920" end="01:03:00.319the because this is just the metadata
1:02:58.160" end="01:03:01.680right it's not the content so So like
1:03:00.319" end="01:03:05.520let's say I'm just thinking about a blog
1:03:01.680" end="01:03:08.240post may be added or updated or changed.
1:03:05.520" end="01:03:11.520So let's see how this is checking how
1:03:08.240" end="01:03:14.640duplicates are handled. Updates. So it's
1:03:11.520" end="01:03:17.520now adding the repository to make sure
1:03:14.640" end="01:03:19.920that updated repository to skip
1:03:17.520" end="01:03:23.280duplicates instead of updating them.
1:03:19.920" end="01:03:24.960Okay. In it's not really going to affect
1:03:23.280" end="01:03:26.960us really much at this stage especially
1:03:24.960" end="01:03:29.839if we run it every 24 hours. But if you
1:03:26.960" end="01:03:32.799want to run it faster for example then
1:03:29.839" end="01:03:36.079let's see then you may run into some
1:03:32.799" end="01:03:37.760issues there. So this is now changed. So
1:03:36.079" end="01:03:39.599this is now in the repository right. So
1:03:37.760" end="01:03:41.520yeah it's updating all of this and like
1:03:39.599" end="01:03:44.559this is now the beauty since we're using
1:03:41.520" end="01:03:46.319SQL alchemy. All of these these are
1:03:44.559" end="01:03:48.400these this is what you call the database
1:03:46.319" end="01:03:51.760repository where look this is how we
1:03:48.400" end="01:03:54.400create an open AI article. But because
1:03:51.760" end="01:03:56.079we have the models like I don't really
1:03:54.400" end="01:03:58.240even have to look at this and I can
1:03:56.079" end="01:04:00.000trust AI to do this really well because
1:03:58.240" end="01:04:02.160it literally has an example of look
1:04:00.000" end="01:04:04.319here's how you need to do it connection
1:04:02.160" end="01:04:06.079works we created a table these are the
1:04:04.319" end="01:04:08.079models and this is the repository that
1:04:06.079" end="01:04:10.640we now use to to interact with this so
1:04:08.079" end="01:04:13.200what I'm going to do right now is I am
1:04:10.640" end="01:04:18.240going to actually expand this a little
1:04:13.200" end="01:04:20.400bit to say look ours is
1:04:18.240" end="01:04:25.839actually I
1:04:20.400" end="01:04:28.240I don't like this for now. Let's just do
1:04:25.839" end="01:04:30.400150. Let's let's let's just give it a
1:04:28.240" end="01:04:33.280spin. And I I think so right now I can
1:04:30.400" end="01:04:35.359also run it like this. So this will take
1:04:33.280" end="01:04:38.400us time. There we go. Four YouTube
1:04:35.359" end="01:04:40.720videos, seven articles from Entropic and
1:04:38.400" end="01:04:42.400two from OpenAI and two from Entropic.
1:04:40.720" end="01:04:46.480Okay, let's have a look at what this
1:04:42.400" end="01:04:50.240looks like. There we go. So we have the
1:04:46.480" end="01:04:52.319GUID. There we have all of it. This is
1:04:50.240" end="01:04:54.960now
1:04:52.319" end="01:04:56.880beautiful. We have the title in there.
1:04:54.960" end="01:04:59.599Okay. So, this is this is starting to
1:04:56.880" end="01:05:02.799look like something guys. This is now we
1:04:59.599" end="01:05:05.280can we can start working with this. We
1:05:02.799" end="01:05:06.960have a flexible system.
1:05:05.280" end="01:05:12.799Oh, here's one thing. This is this is
1:05:06.960" end="01:05:16.160tricky. Why is this so the video ID?
1:05:12.799" end="01:05:19.520What is Can you have a look at this for
1:05:16.160" end="01:05:21.680one of the IDs? It is the URL instead of
1:05:19.520" end="01:05:23.200the ID. Is this maybe because it starts
1:05:21.680" end="01:05:26.960with an underscore? Can you look into
1:05:23.200" end="01:05:29.599this? And then let's just plug in that
1:05:26.960" end="01:05:32.799image in here. Let me just stop this.
1:05:29.599" end="01:05:35.359Plug in the image. There we go. Okay. So
1:05:32.799" end="01:05:38.960that is so open.
1:05:35.359" end="01:05:42.400Let's see. So it it uses the this is
1:05:38.960" end="01:05:46.480okay. It uses the URL for entropic as
1:05:42.400" end="01:05:48.240well and that's totally fine for now.
1:05:46.480" end="01:05:50.160YouTube videos. Yeah, this this is an
1:05:48.240" end="01:05:52.880issue. This is not we don't want that.
1:05:50.160" end="01:05:55.760Okay. Fix it. Method didn't handle
1:05:52.880" end="01:05:57.920YouTube short. Oh, is a shorts. Okay.
1:05:55.760" end="01:05:59.760Okay. YouTube shorts. What did we
1:05:57.920" end="01:06:03.839update?
1:05:59.760" end="01:06:06.160I should have do There we go. If Yes.
1:06:03.839" end="01:06:08.160Okay. So, that that looks good. Refuse
1:06:06.160" end="01:06:10.880that specifically.
1:06:08.160" end="01:06:15.839Okay. Okay, keep all. Now, what if we
1:06:10.880" end="01:06:18.480get rid of this, save it, and
1:06:15.839" end="01:06:20.960come back to
1:06:18.480" end="01:06:24.319Yes, come back to over here. Let's first
1:06:20.960" end="01:06:27.760make sure we commit everything again.
1:06:24.319" end="01:06:29.119Okay, so we are good in this. But now
1:06:27.760" end="01:06:32.079we're just going to run this one more
1:06:29.119" end="01:06:34.799time and let's see if it correctly
1:06:32.079" end="01:06:37.039handled the YouTube short in there as
1:06:34.799" end="01:06:40.000well. There we go. Okay, coming back to
1:06:37.039" end="01:06:43.599our database YouTube videos. Refresh.
1:06:40.000" end="01:06:48.319There we go. Now we have that nice nice
1:06:43.599" end="01:06:50.640and neat in there. Do we just thinking
1:06:48.319" end="01:06:52.559because we we are going to run probably
1:06:50.640" end="01:06:54.559into issues with getting a transcript
1:06:52.559" end="01:06:56.960from a short. So I'm just thinking
1:06:54.559" end="01:06:59.680whether we actually want to include
1:06:56.960" end="01:07:02.160shorts. I don't want to include shorts.
1:06:59.680" end="01:07:04.559I don't want that. Can you actually make
1:07:02.160" end="01:07:07.680it so that shorts are skipped entirely?
1:07:04.559" end="01:07:11.280I don't want them in the database
1:07:07.680" end="01:07:14.640because the thing is this is not really
1:07:11.280" end="01:07:17.039shorts are us on channels are usually
1:07:14.640" end="01:07:19.839snippets from longer form videos as
1:07:17.039" end="01:07:22.079well. So for now I'm just going to make
1:07:19.839" end="01:07:25.599the decision to not do that. So we can
1:07:22.079" end="01:07:28.160see look here it is if shorts in entry
1:07:25.599" end="01:07:33.280link we continue. We don't want it.
1:07:28.160" end="01:07:36.160Let's do it like this. And now if we
1:07:33.280" end="01:07:38.000run this I think
1:07:36.160" end="01:07:39.920or I believe it will not be in there but
1:07:38.000" end="01:07:43.039it should also say that we found three
1:07:39.920" end="01:07:45.200videos. Yes, you see three videos
1:07:43.039" end="01:07:48.960instead of four. So we apply the
1:07:45.200" end="01:07:53.599filtering. We run that. Okay. Hey, we're
1:07:48.960" end="01:07:55.280making amazing progress. Okay. So now,
1:07:53.599" end="01:07:57.760like I said, this is going really well.
1:07:55.280" end="01:07:59.520We're already making some big moves in
1:07:57.760" end="01:08:01.839here. So now I I pretty much want to
1:07:59.520" end="01:08:05.119create
1:08:01.839" end="01:08:07.520I'm I want to create the agent
1:08:05.119" end="01:08:09.200or do we first
1:08:07.520" end="01:08:11.440Okay. So there's one more thing that's
1:08:09.200" end="01:08:13.920getting the No, no, no. We want stage
1:08:11.440" end="01:08:16.319two. Okay. Now what I want you to do is
1:08:13.920" end="01:08:20.159I want you to work on stage two of the
1:08:16.319" end="01:08:23.839processing pipeline where for entropic
1:08:20.159" end="01:08:25.359we for all the articles or blog post or
1:08:23.839" end="01:08:28.799new for all the entries that are in the
1:08:25.359" end="01:08:30.960database that don't have a the markdown
1:08:28.799" end="01:08:33.679extracted from the page we want to run
1:08:30.960" end="01:08:37.600that and get that and similar for
1:08:33.679" end="01:08:41.679YouTube we want to get the transcripts
1:08:37.600" end="01:08:42.640from the videos that are in the in the
1:08:41.679" end="01:08:46.239database.
1:08:42.640" end="01:08:48.000And do we need to extend the database
1:08:46.239" end="01:08:50.159structure in order to do this? What what
1:08:48.000" end="01:08:52.400would make the most sense? Do we create
1:08:50.159" end="01:08:54.799another linked table or just do we
1:08:52.400" end="01:08:56.480extend the current do we extend the
1:08:54.799" end="01:08:58.480current tables and add it at the same
1:08:56.480" end="01:09:02.159records which to me sounds easier. What
1:08:58.480" end="01:09:04.480do you think? Let's ask it first
1:09:02.159" end="01:09:06.080because again this is an architectural
1:09:04.480" end="01:09:07.279decision. So what what I just asked
1:09:06.080" end="01:09:09.679pretty much like look if we have the
1:09:07.279" end="01:09:12.480entropic article we know that with
1:09:09.679" end="01:09:15.359dockling we can also get the full text.
1:09:12.480" end="01:09:18.880We could simply create another column in
1:09:15.359" end="01:09:21.759this database where we plug that or we
1:09:18.880" end="01:09:24.000create a separate table for it which
1:09:21.759" end="01:09:26.400would be a little bit nicer easier to
1:09:24.000" end="01:09:28.640scale but I think for now I just want to
1:09:26.400" end="01:09:30.080extend the schema because it it just
1:09:28.640" end="01:09:34.960makes things easier. I want to extend
1:09:30.080" end="01:09:36.319the column. So what is it saying? It's a
1:09:34.960" end="01:09:38.080reviewing database structure
1:09:36.319" end="01:09:40.319recommendation. Extend the current
1:09:38.080" end="01:09:44.319tables with new columns. Reasons 101.
1:09:40.319" end="01:09:48.159Yeah, exactly. That's easier. No joints.
1:09:44.319" end="01:09:50.640Yeah. Proposed changes.
1:09:48.159" end="01:09:53.520Create a processing script that curies
1:09:50.640" end="01:09:56.480YouTube videos for transcript is no.
1:09:53.520" end="01:09:59.199Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah, that makes
1:09:56.480" end="01:10:02.239sense. Yeah. Let's do the entropic one
1:09:59.199" end="01:10:04.960first. Let's start there. Okay. So now
1:10:02.239" end="01:10:06.719what what it's going to do it's look
1:10:04.960" end="01:10:09.040yeah because we need to extend the
1:10:06.719" end="01:10:11.040database models
1:10:09.040" end="01:10:13.440there we go so now this is in here as
1:10:11.040" end="01:10:15.040well but this is not directly reflected
1:10:13.440" end="01:10:16.560in the database so this is typically
1:10:15.040" end="01:10:19.920what you would create a database
1:10:16.560" end="01:10:22.320migration file for but yeah like I said
1:10:19.920" end="01:10:24.159so now look
1:10:22.320" end="01:10:26.480since it's early stage and we're in
1:10:24.159" end="01:10:29.920development what I can now do is I could
1:10:26.480" end="01:10:32.080pretty much run this create tables but
1:10:29.920" end="01:10:35.600now I'm assuming this This is all empty
1:10:32.080" end="01:10:38.000again. Like is that the case or h wait
1:10:35.600" end="01:10:40.960what did it do? Does this actually
1:10:38.000" end="01:10:43.199persist? Where's the I also don't see
1:10:40.960" end="01:10:45.280the category? I don't see the table
1:10:43.199" end="01:10:47.280either. Wait, wait, wait. Where are we?
1:10:45.280" end="01:10:49.679Tables created successfully. Update the
1:10:47.280" end="01:10:51.360database schema. Yeah, run the
1:10:49.679" end="01:10:55.120processor. Process articles without
1:10:51.360" end="01:10:57.360markdown or pro specific number.
1:10:55.120" end="01:10:59.280What's going on? We got the entropic
1:10:57.360" end="01:11:03.120articles. We have markdown in there as
1:10:59.280" end="01:11:06.080well. So it should be where
1:11:03.120" end="01:11:08.800what's going on. Okay. So now we have a
1:11:06.080" end="01:11:11.199little bit of tinkering here to figure
1:11:08.800" end="01:11:15.840out why if we run the create tables
1:11:11.199" end="01:11:17.920again why it's not let's actually check
1:11:15.840" end="01:11:19.360when I run the create tables.py again
1:11:17.920" end="01:11:22.000nothing happens. Is this because the
1:11:19.360" end="01:11:24.400table already exists? How do does SQL
1:11:22.000" end="01:11:25.679alchemy usually handle that? So I know
1:11:24.400" end="01:11:27.920that if you want to do it proper you
1:11:25.679" end="01:11:29.440want to do data database migration.
1:11:27.920" end="01:11:32.239Right now we don't need that's
1:11:29.440" end="01:11:36.080completely okay to override it. Yeah. So
1:11:32.239" end="01:11:38.239that's that's the thing. So let's see.
1:11:36.080" end="01:11:40.880Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So now what we
1:11:38.239" end="01:11:44.719this is going to be temporary file.
1:11:40.880" end="01:11:46.560Yeah. This is a temporary file to just
1:11:44.719" end="01:11:48.239add.
1:11:46.560" end="01:11:51.199Will this run? I think this will run.
1:11:48.239" end="01:11:53.840Yeah. So the
1:11:51.199" end="01:11:55.840create tables we do create all this. So
1:11:53.840" end="01:11:57.120it said this only creates tables if they
1:11:55.840" end="01:11:58.560don't exist. So I could have either
1:11:57.120" end="01:12:00.400said, look, I'm going to remove
1:11:58.560" end="01:12:03.520everything and run it one more time. But
1:12:00.400" end="01:12:06.000now I have a separate temporary script
1:12:03.520" end="01:12:07.600that I can now get rid of. And now if I
1:12:06.000" end="01:12:09.520come in here, you can see now we have
1:12:07.600" end="01:12:11.600the markdown. We have the markdown
1:12:09.520" end="01:12:13.280column in here. Okay. So that that
1:12:11.600" end="01:12:17.280works. That works. So now let's get rid
1:12:13.280" end="01:12:20.960of this. That's it. And then
1:12:17.280" end="01:12:24.320let's see. We have that in there. And
1:12:20.960" end="01:12:26.000what was the other advice or next steps?
1:12:24.320" end="01:12:27.760So we have that and we do run the
1:12:26.000" end="01:12:30.239processor. So that's the process
1:12:27.760" end="01:12:32.640entropic.py. We have the scraper. We
1:12:30.239" end="01:12:36.080have the repo articles.
1:12:32.640" end="01:12:39.440Yes. Fil for article. Okay. So what it
1:12:36.080" end="01:12:42.080created a surface to process the
1:12:39.440" end="01:12:44.960entropic articles. I think I like this.
1:12:42.080" end="01:12:46.320But we can we may want to refac because
1:12:44.960" end="01:12:48.560what is it doing with the scraper? Yeah.
1:12:46.320" end="01:12:49.920Okay. We may want to refactor this later
1:12:48.560" end="01:12:51.600because now pretty much what it will do
1:12:49.920" end="01:12:54.800is we will say look I'm going to like
1:12:51.600" end="01:12:57.520query everything that's in here. where
1:12:54.800" end="01:13:00.320let's see how is it doing that read
1:12:57.520" end="01:13:04.080where's the repository look so in the
1:13:00.320" end="01:13:06.159repository it added two new functions in
1:13:04.080" end="01:13:08.880here to say look I want to get the
1:13:06.159" end="01:13:10.400entropic articles without markdown where
1:13:08.880" end="01:13:12.719so we pretty much say we're going to
1:13:10.400" end="01:13:14.640apply a filter so this works well this
1:13:12.719" end="01:13:16.400is very efficient and then we're going
1:13:14.640" end="01:13:19.280to update that as well so that's that's
1:13:16.400" end="01:13:20.719good it works for now let's continue
1:13:19.280" end="01:13:22.400with it so it's going to say look we
1:13:20.719" end="01:13:24.320have the scraper we have the repository
1:13:22.400" end="01:13:26.800let's get all of the articles Let's try
1:13:24.320" end="01:13:28.880and scrape them using URL to markdown
1:13:26.800" end="01:13:30.800which is the dock link converter going
1:13:28.880" end="01:13:32.560very fast right now but this is just
1:13:30.800" end="01:13:35.040going through everything and also like
1:13:32.560" end="01:13:38.719myself trying to understand it. If we
1:13:35.040" end="01:13:42.400have if we manage to get the markdown is
1:13:38.719" end="01:13:45.920this in a try like probably
1:13:42.400" end="01:13:50.000we should try
1:13:45.920" end="01:13:54.080and accept and and catch this. So it it
1:13:50.000" end="01:13:56.719won't error. Let's see it. Try if
1:13:54.080" end="01:13:58.640markdown else failed.
1:13:56.719" end="01:14:00.080Yeah, otherwise it's empty. I think this
1:13:58.640" end="01:14:04.159is better. Okay, so it's going to do
1:14:00.080" end="01:14:07.040that. And let's see. We have
1:14:04.159" end="01:14:09.520we can process that. I just want to run
1:14:07.040" end="01:14:14.080everything. I don't want to limit in
1:14:09.520" end="01:14:17.280here. Is it optional? Yeah, no need to
1:14:14.080" end="01:14:19.760limit this. Okay, let's see because we
1:14:17.280" end="01:14:21.280only have two. What is it? We have two
1:14:19.760" end="01:14:24.480articles in here. But let's let's see if
1:14:21.280" end="01:14:26.719we can get the markdown. Let's run this.
1:14:24.480" end="01:14:28.239Boom. No module named app. Of course
1:14:26.719" end="01:14:30.800not.
1:14:28.239" end="01:14:33.760That's where we have the annoying thing
1:14:30.800" end="01:14:37.040again. We need to do this. There we go.
1:14:33.760" end="01:14:38.640This should work. Or is it? No, I don't.
1:14:37.040" end="01:14:41.199This works. Okay. Total articles
1:14:38.640" end="01:14:43.199processed filled. Perfect. Let's
1:14:41.199" end="01:14:47.440refresh.
1:14:43.199" end="01:14:49.120Look at this. We got the Oh, this is not
1:14:47.440" end="01:14:51.920This is not pretty. But let's see. We
1:14:49.120" end="01:14:56.800got the We got the markdown. We got the
1:14:51.920" end="01:14:59.920markdown. Let's see. Test.md.
1:14:56.800" end="01:15:02.000We got the markdown. This is perfect.
1:14:59.920" end="01:15:05.440Okay. It works. It works. It works. It
1:15:02.000" end="01:15:07.760works. That is perfect. So that is now
1:15:05.440" end="01:15:11.120coming together nicely. Okay. So then
1:15:07.760" end="01:15:12.480next I want to do is with YouTube. Okay.
1:15:11.120" end="01:15:16.080Okay, so now let's do the same thing
1:15:12.480" end="01:15:18.400with YouTube where for all of the videos
1:15:16.080" end="01:15:20.800that don't have a transcript yet, we try
1:15:18.400" end="01:15:22.960and get the transcript,
1:15:20.800" end="01:15:27.920but we also want to make sure that
1:15:22.960" end="01:15:30.960whenever that fails for some reason, we
1:15:27.920" end="01:15:33.600maybe mark it with transcript is not
1:15:30.960" end="01:15:35.600available or or something like that. So
1:15:33.600" end="01:15:37.360we don't like run into loops and issues
1:15:35.600" end="01:15:39.120where every time we try and process
1:15:37.360" end="01:15:42.480videos because I know not for all videos
1:15:39.120" end="01:15:46.719this is possible. Okay, again before AI
1:15:42.480" end="01:15:48.560goes crazy I need to commit this. So we
1:15:46.719" end="01:15:52.159have process entropic. Okay, so this is
1:15:48.560" end="01:15:54.800another we can use this as as yeah we
1:15:52.159" end="01:15:56.320can use this as part of our like main
1:15:54.800" end="01:15:58.400runner down the line where we can say
1:15:56.320" end="01:16:00.239look we're going to get we're going to
1:15:58.400" end="01:16:02.880fill up the database and then for
1:16:00.239" end="01:16:05.280specific sources within our database we
1:16:02.880" end="01:16:08.400want to run this extra processing on top
1:16:05.280" end="01:16:10.719of it. So let's see it's doing stuff.
1:16:08.400" end="01:16:13.679What is it doing? It's expanding the
1:16:10.719" end="01:16:15.920repository. Yeah. So, this is a very
1:16:13.679" end="01:16:17.199clean pattern as you can see where all
1:16:15.920" end="01:16:19.120the stuff that you need to do with the
1:16:17.199" end="01:16:20.640database, you just add it to your
1:16:19.120" end="01:16:22.560repository.
1:16:20.640" end="01:16:24.239Yeah. Later down the line if it gets
1:16:22.560" end="01:16:26.960really big, you may want to think about
1:16:24.239" end="01:16:29.280restructuring this or reusing some
1:16:26.960" end="01:16:32.159patterns, but for now, this all works.
1:16:29.280" end="01:16:34.400So, we don't have to worry about any of
1:16:32.159" end="01:16:36.719that stuff. So, now let's see. Okay, we
1:16:34.400" end="01:16:40.400have we have the repository and we have
1:16:36.719" end="01:16:42.480the process YouTube. So then transcript,
1:16:40.400" end="01:16:44.719we have an a marker in there. What's it
1:16:42.480" end="01:16:49.600doing? I like that by the way. Okay, we
1:16:44.719" end="01:16:53.679do try accept. Yes. Okay, let's
1:16:49.600" end="01:16:55.199get rid of this. I also don't want this.
1:16:53.679" end="01:16:58.000And
1:16:55.199" end="01:17:00.239yes. Okay. Now, one thing that I know
1:16:58.000" end="01:17:03.199about using the YouTube transcript API
1:17:00.239" end="01:17:05.360because we're using the YouTube internal
1:17:03.199" end="01:17:07.199API, it could be that at some point,
1:17:05.360" end="01:17:10.719especially if you follow a lot of
1:17:07.199" end="01:17:12.960sources, you YouTube will temporarily IP
1:17:10.719" end="01:17:14.800block you. There is a way around this.
1:17:12.960" end="01:17:17.520It's quite easy, but you need to pay
1:17:14.800" end="01:17:21.440around like 4 USD, 5 USD per month for a
1:17:17.520" end="01:17:23.280surface. I probably will add that to it
1:17:21.440" end="01:17:25.040because otherwise we may already run
1:17:23.280" end="01:17:28.239into issues right now. But let's let's
1:17:25.040" end="01:17:29.760see if it works. So, let's actually Is
1:17:28.239" end="01:17:32.000the
1:17:29.760" end="01:17:34.480because is the is the is the database
1:17:32.000" end="01:17:36.239already updated? Probably not, right?
1:17:34.480" end="01:17:39.360How what how did it do that? Did this
1:17:36.239" end="01:17:42.400did it run that on its own or was that
1:17:39.360" end="01:17:45.280always part of the game already? Okay,
1:17:42.400" end="01:17:47.280cool. Okay, good thinking there from the
1:17:45.280" end="01:17:51.199AI.
1:17:47.280" end="01:17:53.120Let's run this. So now for
1:17:51.199" end="01:17:56.320three videos,
1:17:53.120" end="01:17:58.159it should get the transcript.
1:17:56.320" end="01:18:00.960I keep tabbing back to this one. I don't
1:17:58.159" end="01:18:04.480want that. Sorry. Sorry for the jumping.
1:18:00.960" end="01:18:07.280Let's run this. What will it do? Total
1:18:04.480" end="01:18:12.320videos processed unavailable. Okay, this
1:18:07.280" end="01:18:15.280is good. This is good. Refresh.
1:18:12.320" end="01:18:17.040Don't you love seeing this? We got a
1:18:15.280" end="01:18:19.520transcript.
1:18:17.040" end="01:18:22.400So again, what does this look like? Just
1:18:19.520" end="01:18:25.040dumping it in here. Okay, so it's a long
1:18:22.400" end="01:18:27.440string. Okay, this this is good. This is
1:18:25.040" end="01:18:30.560good. This is good. We got another piece
1:18:27.440" end="01:18:33.679of the puzzle. And like I said, like if
1:18:30.560" end="01:18:36.719I'm going to show you YouTube transcript
1:18:33.679" end="01:18:38.000API for now, I don't run into errors,
1:18:36.719" end="01:18:40.560but I want to show you this now. It's
1:18:38.000" end="01:18:44.719It's on the GitHub. Uh where is it? It's
1:18:40.560" end="01:18:46.000on the It's on their GitHub. There we
1:18:44.719" end="01:18:48.719go.
1:18:46.000" end="01:18:53.120If you have a lot of videos, at some
1:18:48.719" end="01:18:55.040point you're going to hit a wall. And if
1:18:53.120" end="01:18:58.080there's a workaround, if you get this
1:18:55.040" end="01:19:00.960request blocked, IP blocked, you can go
1:18:58.080" end="01:19:03.280to web share. I have an account in here.
1:19:00.960" end="01:19:06.080Let's see pricing.
1:19:03.280" end="01:19:09.679I am So, it's it's crazy cheap. It's
1:19:06.080" end="01:19:11.600what I have. It's You should get a I
1:19:09.679" end="01:19:13.040think rotating residential. This is the
1:19:11.600" end="01:19:15.199one that you need. Yeah, this is the one
1:19:13.040" end="01:19:17.520you need. A rotating residential. I got
1:19:15.199" end="01:19:20.320the cheapest plan.
1:19:17.520" end="01:19:22.480That's that's enough. That's enough that
1:19:20.320" end="01:19:26.480you need. And then what you can do is
1:19:22.480" end="01:19:29.120you can establish the YouTube transcript
1:19:26.480" end="01:19:32.320API with a proxy config. So that's how
1:19:29.120" end="01:19:36.480that works. So if you then come to the
1:19:32.320" end="01:19:38.320YouTube scraper surface, let's see. I'm
1:19:36.480" end="01:19:42.159actually, you know what? I'm going to
1:19:38.320" end="01:19:44.159build it in optional just to show you
1:19:42.159" end="01:19:45.920what that would look like because
1:19:44.159" end="01:19:50.159YouTube
1:19:45.920" end="01:19:56.080in here get transcript. Please extend
1:19:50.159" end="01:20:00.640this so that when n fars are present we
1:19:56.080" end="01:20:04.080use the proxy the proy the proxy you
1:20:00.640" end="01:20:08.400don't see this and otherwise no proxy
1:20:04.080" end="01:20:11.199okay proxies none and then we do do we
1:20:08.400" end="01:20:12.719need the host no we just need username
1:20:11.199" end="01:20:14.880password
1:20:12.719" end="01:20:16.640so I'm just giving it the actual example
1:20:14.880" end="01:20:18.320here because it is too much going on
1:20:16.640" end="01:20:22.000here it can be way simpler yeah That's
1:20:18.320" end="01:20:26.480it. If proxy username and password proxy
1:20:22.000" end="01:20:28.719config is that proxy config is none. Is
1:20:26.480" end="01:20:31.440that acceptable? Yeah, that is
1:20:28.719" end="01:20:33.840acceptable. That's good. So then you
1:20:31.440" end="01:20:37.120should get your proxy username and
1:20:33.840" end="01:20:39.360password. So that is from web share. You
1:20:37.120" end="01:20:41.199could get those credentials. It's
1:20:39.360" end="01:20:43.120explained.
1:20:41.199" end="01:20:46.159Yeah, like I said, it's explained in
1:20:43.120" end="01:20:48.400here. That's how you can that's how you
1:20:46.159" end="01:20:52.159can bypass that. But for now, we're
1:20:48.400" end="01:20:54.640good. And we can continue with another
1:20:52.159" end="01:20:56.480we can continue with another phase. All
1:20:54.640" end="01:21:01.040right. So, what we're going to do right
1:20:56.480" end="01:21:04.400now is given all of this, I want to
1:21:01.040" end="01:21:07.600create a I want to create I want to
1:21:04.400" end="01:21:10.159start working on the on the digest. So,
1:21:07.600" end="01:21:13.440what I pretty much want to do is I want
1:21:10.159" end="01:21:15.280to go through everything that's in here
1:21:13.440" end="01:21:18.960and I want to create a quick little
1:21:15.280" end="01:21:22.320summary of the information that is
1:21:18.960" end="01:21:25.199available and
1:21:22.320" end="01:21:27.280that we can then later use that in order
1:21:25.199" end="01:21:29.920to aggregate the feed and then also
1:21:27.280" end="01:21:31.760create a filter around. So, let's see
1:21:29.920" end="01:21:34.239let's see what we can do here. So, okay,
1:21:31.760" end="01:21:37.920I'm going to do the following. Okay.
1:21:34.239" end="01:21:40.080Now, next I want to create the agent.
1:21:37.920" end="01:21:42.400And pretty much what I want to do is I
1:21:40.080" end="01:21:44.480want to loop through all of the articles
1:21:42.400" end="01:21:47.679in the database, whether that's YouTube,
1:21:44.480" end="01:21:50.880OpenAI, entropic. And I want to create
1:21:47.679" end="01:21:53.520another table, which is going to be the
1:21:50.880" end="01:21:56.719digest table. And in there, we're going
1:21:53.520" end="01:22:00.400to link to the article. So, it should be
1:21:56.719" end="01:22:05.760a database link. We should also have the
1:22:00.400" end="01:22:09.440URL in there. And then I want to have a
1:22:05.760" end="01:22:11.040two to three sentence summary and a
1:22:09.440" end="01:22:14.719title
1:22:11.040" end="01:22:17.840for that digest article or element. And
1:22:14.719" end="01:22:19.920I want to create the summary using
1:22:17.840" end="01:22:24.000OpenAI. We're going to use the responses
1:22:19.920" end="01:22:28.480API. And we're going to use the GPT4.1
1:22:24.000" end="01:22:31.280mini model with a with an instruction
1:22:28.480" end="01:22:32.480to say to set the context to say look
1:22:31.280" end="01:22:33.679this is your role. Well, this is what
1:22:32.480" end="01:22:38.480you should do. You should create the
1:22:33.679" end="01:22:41.920summary on this. So if you're and then I
1:22:38.480" end="01:22:44.239want the responses API to return a
1:22:41.920" end="01:22:45.840structured output using the text format.
1:22:44.239" end="01:22:47.760So I want you to look up the latest
1:22:45.840" end="01:22:49.840information of the responses API to make
1:22:47.760" end="01:22:54.000sure we get it right. Then I want you to
1:22:49.840" end="01:22:56.000build out the agent in the agent folder
1:22:54.000" end="01:22:59.199and then also make sure to create the
1:22:56.000" end="01:23:02.719new database model so that we have that
1:22:59.199" end="01:23:05.199and then create another kind of runner
1:23:02.719" end="01:23:08.560or yeah something like that where we can
1:23:05.199" end="01:23:10.080or a processor. Is this a surface? Yeah,
1:23:08.560" end="01:23:12.080I think yeah, this should be another
1:23:10.080" end="01:23:14.639surface where we process the we can call
1:23:12.080" end="01:23:17.040it process digest to go through
1:23:14.639" end="01:23:18.800everything to create the short summaries
1:23:17.040" end="01:23:21.520where the input of that of course should
1:23:18.800" end="01:23:23.760be everything that we have within the
1:23:21.520" end="01:23:25.360within the database row. Okay, this is a
1:23:23.760" end="01:23:27.600this is a big one but I believe you can
1:23:25.360" end="01:23:29.920do this. Give it a little bit of extra
1:23:27.600" end="01:23:31.520motivation.
1:23:29.920" end="01:23:33.360Okay,
1:23:31.520" end="01:23:35.120definitely want to do a check in here
1:23:33.360" end="01:23:37.679because
1:23:35.120" end="01:23:39.280we're going a little bit crazy here.
1:23:37.679" end="01:23:41.440It's going to be it's going to be
1:23:39.280" end="01:23:44.480because we
1:23:41.440" end="01:23:46.800actually you should first like establish
1:23:44.480" end="01:23:48.960responses API set up your environment
1:23:46.800" end="01:23:51.600variables but I'm just already just go
1:23:48.960" end="01:23:54.560ahead and say like look we need an open
1:23:51.600" end="01:23:57.679AI API key because that that's what
1:23:54.560" end="01:24:01.600we're going to need. Let's see have that
1:23:57.679" end="01:24:04.960in here. Make sure we add that to
1:24:01.600" end="01:24:08.239the config as well. And while we let
1:24:04.960" end="01:24:10.480everything run over here, going to
1:24:08.239" end="01:24:12.159quickly plug that in there. Stop the
1:24:10.480" end="01:24:14.000recording for you. Oh, no. What? I can
1:24:12.159" end="01:24:17.840actually do this. Look, I just have to
1:24:14.000" end="01:24:22.080look at me while I am secretly getting
1:24:17.840" end="01:24:25.040my API key. Where is it? I'm getting my
1:24:22.080" end="01:24:29.920API key. I'm going to plug that in there
1:24:25.040" end="01:24:32.560right now. Save it. Close it. All right.
1:24:29.920" end="01:24:34.800And we're back. Okay. Okay, so it
1:24:32.560" end="01:24:36.960created a big plan.
1:24:34.800" end="01:24:39.120It's going to research responses API.
1:24:36.960" end="01:24:40.800That's all good. Create digest database
1:24:39.120" end="01:24:43.679model with article reference. Okay.
1:24:40.800" end="01:24:46.239Boom. There we go. It's going to create
1:24:43.679" end="01:24:50.080the model. Let's see what it comes up
1:24:46.239" end="01:24:52.800with. Oh, this is a good category. That
1:24:50.080" end="01:24:55.600is good because then we can also let the
1:24:52.800" end="01:24:59.199LLM actually create some metadata on it.
1:24:55.600" end="01:25:02.719So, ID, article type, feed, that's good.
1:24:59.199" end="01:25:04.719Digest agent. This is good. So now I
1:25:02.719" end="01:25:06.719could also do this because now look
1:25:04.719" end="01:25:10.800because since it's a new table
1:25:06.719" end="01:25:13.040successfully created refresh digests and
1:25:10.800" end="01:25:15.600we have it in here. So that's good.
1:25:13.040" end="01:25:18.639We're moving fast here. We're moving
1:25:15.600" end="01:25:22.000fast. We have the digest agent digest
1:25:18.639" end="01:25:25.120output title summary.
1:25:22.000" end="01:25:28.000This is okay.
1:25:25.120" end="01:25:31.600Verifying the outputs. What are we
1:25:28.000" end="01:25:33.840doing? Pared. Yeah. if context.
1:25:31.600" end="01:25:37.440Okay,
1:25:33.840" end="01:25:39.440I already see some some mistakes that we
1:25:37.440" end="01:25:41.760need to course correct here, but we're
1:25:39.440" end="01:25:45.199getting Oh, yeah. Okay, got it. Yeah,
1:25:41.760" end="01:25:49.040wait. Keep all. Let's actually first of
1:25:45.199" end="01:25:50.880all, I [clears throat] I never really
1:25:49.040" end="01:25:55.199like it
1:25:50.880" end="01:25:57.760when when this is all weird like this.
1:25:55.199" end="01:26:02.400So, let's actually just grab that. Set
1:25:57.760" end="01:26:06.480the prompt at the top. Yaw. Okay. System
1:26:02.400" end="01:26:08.880prompt is prompt. What's this? Did we I
1:26:06.480" end="01:26:11.760missed that. Wait, wait, wait. How's
1:26:08.880" end="01:26:13.520this? Ah, we have we have one more thing
1:26:11.760" end="01:26:16.520over here. So, we also have the user
1:26:13.520" end="01:26:16.520prompt.
1:26:16.880" end="01:26:24.560Let's just first see if it works. But
1:26:20.719" end="01:26:29.679open AI responses.
1:26:24.560" end="01:26:32.800And then what do I need? I just want
1:26:29.679" end="01:26:35.679structured output.
1:26:32.800" end="01:26:39.280And then I want the first example in
1:26:35.679" end="01:26:45.120here. Yes.
1:26:39.280" end="01:26:48.960And then I say use this approach
1:26:45.120" end="01:26:50.639not the beta version
1:26:48.960" end="01:26:52.639because it's using I noticed that it's
1:26:50.639" end="01:26:54.480using client beta chat completions. So
1:26:52.639" end="01:26:56.320it's not using the responses API in
1:26:54.480" end="01:26:58.639here. So just give it this example. So
1:26:56.320" end="01:27:01.040look, you need client responses parse.
1:26:58.639" end="01:27:02.800This is what I want you to do. And what
1:27:01.040" end="01:27:04.639else were we touching? So we created the
1:27:02.800" end="01:27:07.440models. So that's good. We created a
1:27:04.639" end="01:27:09.040repository to
1:27:07.440" end="01:27:11.199update the articles. That's good.
1:27:09.040" end="01:27:15.840Process digest.
1:27:11.199" end="01:27:19.040That's also good. And then
1:27:15.840" end="01:27:23.360generate digest. So this is create a
1:27:19.040" end="01:27:25.300digest for this article type
1:27:23.360" end="01:27:27.280title
1:27:25.300" end="01:27:30.080[clears throat] content.
1:27:27.280" end="01:27:32.960I think this is good to limit that to
1:27:30.080" end="01:27:34.480some degree. Yeah, let's actually just
1:27:32.960" end="01:27:36.480create
1:27:34.480" end="01:27:39.840can actually just like use some new
1:27:36.480" end="01:27:44.080lines in here just to
1:27:39.840" end="01:27:46.800that should work. So we have the inputs.
1:27:44.080" end="01:27:49.120You know what? We can actually we can
1:27:46.800" end="01:27:53.040just use the instructions.
1:27:49.120" end="01:27:54.560This is going to be Yeah. GT4 mini
1:27:53.040" end="01:27:58.520temperature.
1:27:54.560" end="01:27:58.520Where's Where's the temp
1:27:58.880" end="01:28:02.639KKK?
1:28:00.639" end="01:28:05.600ESD is now working. Is this going to
1:28:02.639" end="01:28:07.760work? Because we're doing a lot here.
1:28:05.600" end="01:28:10.639You are an expert, a news analyst,
1:28:07.760" end="01:28:13.199summarizing technical articles.
1:28:10.639" end="01:28:16.480I also want I want to have a category in
1:28:13.199" end="01:28:17.679here. I want this to be a literal.
1:28:16.480" end="01:28:19.920You know what? Let's actually not do
1:28:17.679" end="01:28:23.199that for now. I think we can later do
1:28:19.920" end="01:28:27.199that, but for now I don't. Okay, how do
1:28:23.199" end="01:28:29.840we run this? We need open API key. We
1:28:27.199" end="01:28:32.639because if we go in here, we do load.
1:28:29.840" end="01:28:35.840Yeah, we got that. That's good. Then we
1:28:32.639" end="01:28:38.639need process digest. So, let's see.
1:28:35.840" end="01:28:42.080Everything should be in place because we
1:28:38.639" end="01:28:44.480have our We almost saw my API key here,
1:28:42.080" end="01:28:46.159but I'm using one password, so it's
1:28:44.480" end="01:28:47.920hidden.
1:28:46.159" end="01:28:50.480Good tip. Love. That's one of my
1:28:47.920" end="01:28:52.639favorite apps, by the way. One password.
1:28:50.480" end="01:28:54.960Um,
1:28:52.639" end="01:28:57.920back to the database.
1:28:54.960" end="01:28:59.760The digest, it's empty. Let's run
1:28:57.920" end="01:29:03.920through this. We have only have a couple
1:28:59.760" end="01:29:06.400of of articles in there. So, let's just
1:29:03.920" end="01:29:11.040run it. What is it doing? is doing this
1:29:06.400" end="01:29:12.560a similar setup. We do a try. We again
1:29:11.040" end="01:29:15.760Well, right now we might just want to
1:29:12.560" end="01:29:19.040set it to one. N it. We'll go We'll
1:29:15.760" end="01:29:22.800go crazy. We'll go crazy. YOLO mode. Run
1:29:19.040" end="01:29:25.760it. This would be pretty pretty sick if
1:29:22.800" end="01:29:27.440we get everything right on the first try
1:29:25.760" end="01:29:31.040because what is what is actually we got
1:29:27.440" end="01:29:33.600the ID, we got a article type, title
1:29:31.040" end="01:29:36.159summary created.
1:29:33.600" end="01:29:37.600What is article type is that I think
1:29:36.159" end="01:29:42.639that's going to be either YouTube
1:29:37.600" end="01:29:44.960entropic or openai. So we see the source
1:29:42.639" end="01:29:46.239where it's coming from. But this is
1:29:44.960" end="01:29:48.159going to take some time because it's
1:29:46.239" end="01:29:52.400going to do a lot of chat completion. So
1:29:48.159" end="01:29:56.800actually already while this is running
1:29:52.400" end="01:29:59.440what I want to do is can you create some
1:29:56.800" end="01:30:01.920logging? Oh, it's already done. Can you
1:29:59.440" end="01:30:04.400create some logging on processing the
1:30:01.920" end="01:30:06.480digest so we can see which video it's
1:30:04.400" end="01:30:09.760currently processing?
1:30:06.480" end="01:30:13.920But let's see. There we go. We got it.
1:30:09.760" end="01:30:15.760We got the ID. Okay, this is not it's
1:30:13.920" end="01:30:18.400not linking,
1:30:15.760" end="01:30:20.239but still fair. This is This works for
1:30:18.400" end="01:30:22.719now. Keep it simple. We got the article
1:30:20.239" end="01:30:26.000ID. That's That's cool. We got Yeah.
1:30:22.719" end="01:30:28.159Okay. We got the URL. That's good. We
1:30:26.000" end="01:30:31.199got the title.
1:30:28.159" end="01:30:34.239We got a summary and we got create. Oh,
1:30:31.199" end="01:30:36.239this this is this is our our daily

1:31:05.760" end="01:31:10.080I always do, for example, let me get
1:31:07.920" end="01:31:12.480into our geni launchpad where we just

1:31:16.400" end="01:31:21.199client projects with. Um,
1:31:19.600" end="01:31:24.080so I'm just like grabbing this git
1:31:21.199" end="01:31:27.920ignore because it's really extensive.
1:31:24.080" end="01:31:30.239plugging that in here. Let's see. This

1:31:30.239" end="01:31:36.719Yes, that's not in here. Let's commit
1:31:33.520" end="01:31:39.920this. Sync the changes. So, we have an
1:31:36.719" end="01:31:43.760agent. We have our digest agent
1:31:39.920" end="01:31:45.360which can run this. And now, now what I
1:31:43.760" end="01:31:48.159want to do, what I want to do, what I
1:31:45.360" end="01:31:49.840want to do, I want to do two things.
1:31:48.159" end="01:31:53.520Okay, awesome. This is working. Now what
1:31:49.840" end="01:31:57.760I want to do is I want to create the
1:31:53.520" end="01:32:01.360aggregator that's going to
1:31:57.760" end="01:32:03.760first let's actually take
1:32:01.360" end="01:32:05.760how are we going to do this? No, first
1:32:03.760" end="01:32:09.040okay let's do this first. We're going to
1:32:05.760" end="01:32:10.880create another agent which we're going
1:32:09.040" end="01:32:13.280to call this what do we call this? How
1:32:10.880" end="01:32:16.000is that called? That is the it's not the
1:32:13.280" end="01:32:18.320director or the orchestrator. How how do
1:32:16.000" end="01:32:20.159you how do you call someone at a news
1:32:18.320" end="01:32:23.199station that does the orchestration or
1:32:20.159" end="01:32:25.600curation of what needs news needs to be
1:32:23.199" end="01:32:27.840put there? I want an agent for that. So
1:32:25.600" end="01:32:31.679I want you give it a name and what that
1:32:27.840" end="01:32:36.880agent should do is it should take the
1:32:31.679" end="01:32:38.960new digests from the last 24 hours.
1:32:36.880" end="01:32:41.760And then what it should do it is it
1:32:38.960" end="01:32:44.239should have a system prompt and then it
1:32:41.760" end="01:32:47.760should a have a user profile and
1:32:44.239" end="01:32:52.080interest and then it should rank the
1:32:47.760" end="01:32:55.679articles from the digests from the last
1:32:52.080" end="01:32:58.63924 hours. It should rank that
1:32:55.679" end="01:33:00.400according to the user profile. So I want
1:32:58.639" end="01:33:01.760you to come up with a user profile. User
1:33:00.400" end="01:33:03.360profile is pretty much look I am
1:33:01.760" end="01:33:05.679interested in XYZ. This is my
1:33:03.360" end="01:33:07.600background. This is all AI related. So
1:33:05.679" end="01:33:09.600it should be tailored towards that. So I
1:33:07.600" end="01:33:11.120want you to create a place in the
1:33:09.600" end="01:33:13.920project where we can have a user
1:33:11.120" end="01:33:17.120profile. Then we're going to grab the
1:33:13.920" end="01:33:19.520information from the database and rank
1:33:17.120" end="01:33:21.760it using another agent that also uses
1:33:19.520" end="01:33:25.600the responses API. So use the exact same
1:33:21.760" end="01:33:27.600setup as you had with the digest agent,
1:33:25.600" end="01:33:30.080but make sure that you create a solid
1:33:27.600" end="01:33:32.800paidic model around it. So we get the
1:33:30.080" end="01:33:35.280ranked list and you should come up with
1:33:32.800" end="01:33:37.840a way to rank it. Maybe we should first
1:33:35.280" end="01:33:40.400give it a score. That could also maybe
1:33:37.840" end="01:33:42.400be done where we give it a score as to
1:33:40.400" end="01:33:44.400how it aligns to the user. What what's
1:33:42.400" end="01:33:47.920the best way to rank things with with an
1:33:44.400" end="01:33:50.400LLM? You decide. Okay, this is going to
1:33:47.920" end="01:33:52.880get this is going to get pretty cool.
1:33:50.400" end="01:33:54.480You understood the assignment. I think I
1:33:52.880" end="01:33:56.480think this is fun. So, we're going to
1:33:54.480" end="01:33:58.560grab everything last 24 hours. Let the
1:33:56.480" end="01:34:02.159LLM based on the profile look at
1:33:58.560" end="01:34:05.120everything. Rank it. And then I want to
1:34:02.159" end="01:34:07.920select how how much is in here? 1 2 3 4
1:34:05.120" end="01:34:09.6009 10. Perfect. I want to do 10. We're
1:34:07.920" end="01:34:11.679going to do top 10. So you get the daily
1:34:09.600" end="01:34:14.159digest of top 10. And then we're going
1:34:11.679" end="01:34:17.360to piece everything together. This is
1:34:14.159" end="01:34:20.239cool. The curator. So it's decided to
1:34:17.360" end="01:34:23.440call it the curator. Okay, perfect.
1:34:20.239" end="01:34:27.679Yeah, we got a score using byentic rank
1:34:23.440" end="01:34:31.120reasoning. That is cool.
1:34:27.679" end="01:34:34.400Yeah, list ranked articles. Beautiful.
1:34:31.120" end="01:34:37.679Now I just want to check. Yeah, this is
1:34:34.400" end="01:34:39.360good. This is good. This is good.
1:34:37.679" end="01:34:41.280Again, I never like it when you have
1:34:39.360" end="01:34:46.960those system prompts all ugly in here,
1:34:41.280" end="01:34:49.920but hey, it should work. So now
1:34:46.960" end="01:34:51.520system prompt creator agent build system
1:34:49.920" end="01:34:53.199prompts.
1:34:51.520" end="01:34:56.639Where's the user profile? Do we have a
1:34:53.199" end="01:34:59.199user profile? We have a user profile.
1:34:56.639" end="01:35:02.800Yeah. Background.
1:34:59.199" end="01:35:05.199Interesting. Interesting. Okay. So now
1:35:02.800" end="01:35:08.239what do we have
1:35:05.199" end="01:35:10.000process creator? Okay. Wait. So it
1:35:08.239" end="01:35:12.000actually
1:35:10.000" end="01:35:14.080it actually already created the service
1:35:12.000" end="01:35:15.920in here. Process curated. But what does
1:35:14.080" end="01:35:18.800it do? Where does it it's going to
1:35:15.920" end="01:35:21.199return? Okay. This is just returning the
1:35:18.800" end="01:35:23.440result. That is
1:35:21.199" end="01:35:26.719that is okay.
1:35:23.440" end="01:35:29.920Let's just do 24 hours. Yeah. This is
1:35:26.719" end="01:35:31.440fun. This is fun because is it using
1:35:29.920" end="01:35:33.920it's using the user profile. Where did
1:35:31.440" end="01:35:36.239it put that? Where is the user profile
1:35:33.920" end="01:35:37.920from user profile profiles? Okay.
1:35:36.239" end="01:35:40.400Created a separate folder for that.
1:35:37.920" end="01:35:42.239That's that's okay. That's fine. What
1:35:40.400" end="01:35:44.320model are we using? A little bit of
1:35:42.239" end="01:35:48.400lower temperature model. Where are we?
1:35:44.320" end="01:35:50.320GT40 mini. Okay. That that will work for
1:35:48.400" end="01:35:53.280now. And now so now we have the process
1:35:50.320" end="01:35:55.520corator. Okay. This is cool. So now this
1:35:53.280" end="01:35:59.280should run. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1:35:55.520" end="01:36:02.800Okay. processing user profile. There we
1:35:59.280" end="01:36:05.920go. Okay. Is this going to be is it's a
1:36:02.800" end="01:36:09.760big one because we're taking all of the
1:36:05.920" end="01:36:12.480articles and we're letting it generate a
1:36:09.760" end="01:36:15.840really big pyantic model. So look, there
1:36:12.480" end="01:36:19.600we go. Yeah, there we go. So now we have
1:36:15.840" end="01:36:22.000the ranked list. This is beautiful
1:36:19.600" end="01:36:24.800people. This is beautiful. Yeah, we got
1:36:22.000" end="01:36:27.360rank ranked list of everything. Does
1:36:24.800" end="01:36:29.120that make sense? Just thinking about for
1:36:27.360" end="01:36:30.719now like because this can get really
1:36:29.120" end="01:36:32.880big. If you have a lot of sources, you
1:36:30.719" end="01:36:34.960do 24 hours. This this list might be
1:36:32.880" end="01:36:36.960really long, but it's still like this is
1:36:34.960" end="01:36:38.480what the aggregator does, right? We need
1:36:36.960" end="01:36:40.719to go through all of this because we
1:36:38.480" end="01:36:42.800need to find the right information.
1:36:40.719" end="01:36:46.239Okay. So
1:36:42.800" end="01:36:49.760then this is the output that we get.
1:36:46.239" end="01:36:54.080So this is awesome. So what the what's
1:36:49.760" end="01:36:56.800the what's with thev file?
1:36:54.080" end="01:36:59.679Why is that? Why is that tracked in
1:36:56.800" end="01:37:02.560here? It's probably I may I may have
1:36:59.679" end="01:37:04.800just have already uploaded it, pushed it
1:37:02.560" end="01:37:08.000to my private repository. Is it in
1:37:04.800" end="01:37:10.560there? See, it's in there. It's already
1:37:08.000" end="01:37:13.520in there. So,
1:37:10.560" end="01:37:15.840let's see. Let's actually go over here.
1:37:13.520" end="01:37:18.880We're good because the API key is not in
1:37:15.840" end="01:37:20.159there. So, what I'm going to do is Is
1:37:18.880" end="01:37:22.560that something you can do? I think you
1:37:20.159" end="01:37:24.080can do it, right? Can I delete this
1:37:22.560" end="01:37:26.159file?
1:37:24.080" end="01:37:28.239This is like really like one of those
1:37:26.159" end="01:37:31.360things where
1:37:28.239" end="01:37:33.920this is so annoying. Okay, this here's
1:37:31.360" end="01:37:35.760actually how I would solve this. You
1:37:33.920" end="01:37:39.520might think like, hey, I'm I'm crazy for
1:37:35.760" end="01:37:43.119this, but I would literally say, hey,
1:37:39.520" end="01:37:44.880look, I accidentally pushed my file to
1:37:43.119" end="01:37:47.360GitHub. I now added it to the git
1:37:44.880" end="01:37:48.880ignore, but it's not correctly
1:37:47.360" end="01:37:51.360recognizing that. We first need to
1:37:48.880" end="01:37:53.440remove it from remote and then keep the
1:37:51.360" end="01:37:54.960local file as is because this contains
1:37:53.440" end="01:37:57.760all the current information. What would
1:37:54.960" end="01:38:00.400be the GitHub commands to do this? Yes,
1:37:57.760" end="01:38:02.800that's that's how I fix that. Even
1:38:00.400" end="01:38:05.199though having more than 10 years of
1:38:02.800" end="01:38:06.960experience working with Python, Git is
1:38:05.199" end="01:38:08.239just like I just know how to use the
1:38:06.960" end="01:38:10.080basics. Whenever there's something
1:38:08.239" end="01:38:12.639annoying like that, I just know that
1:38:10.080" end="01:38:15.520this is the easiest way to do this. So,
1:38:12.639" end="01:38:17.840commands use. So, now I come in here.
1:38:15.520" end="01:38:20.639Now, this should be gone. So you can see
1:38:17.840" end="01:38:23.520this is now gone and now in here it's
1:38:20.639" end="01:38:26.400also it's the file is still in here but
1:38:23.520" end="01:38:28.080it's not tracked anymore. So we fixed it
1:38:26.400" end="01:38:30.080and now I don't have to remember all of
1:38:28.080" end="01:38:32.480the git commands in here. And again you
1:38:30.080" end="01:38:34.000don't want to do this in a production
1:38:32.480" end="01:38:35.760environment.
1:38:34.000" end="01:38:37.520You don't want to do it there. That's
1:38:35.760" end="01:38:39.360why I have my co-founder yours software
1:38:37.520" end="01:38:41.280engineer. He's like the lead engineer on
1:38:39.360" end="01:38:44.000all of the project. Whenever we do crazy
1:38:41.280" end="01:38:46.080stuff like this he's in charge. I just
1:38:44.000" end="01:38:49.280work on my own branch so I can mess with
1:38:46.080" end="01:38:53.600things. He's in control.
1:38:49.280" end="01:38:55.520Okay, let's continue because we are
1:38:53.600" end="01:38:59.199making great progress. So now we have a
1:38:55.520" end="01:39:02.800curator. So now I can come back to let's
1:38:59.199" end="01:39:05.840see where were we? Yeah. Okay, we are
1:39:02.800" end="01:39:08.320back over here is let's think what do we
1:39:05.840" end="01:39:11.040need to do right now? We need to
1:39:08.320" end="01:39:13.679generate the email. We need to generate
1:39:11.040" end="01:39:15.920the email. Okay. And now next what I
1:39:13.679" end="01:39:17.920want you to do is I want you to create
1:39:15.920" end="01:39:20.000another agent. This is going to be the
1:39:17.920" end="01:39:22.960email agent. And what this is going to
1:39:20.000" end="01:39:25.760do this is going to take the output from
1:39:22.960" end="01:39:27.360the curator agent
1:39:25.760" end="01:39:31.360and
1:39:27.360" end="01:39:33.360it's going to take the the best 10
1:39:31.360" end="01:39:36.880digest articles. So it's going to limit
1:39:33.360" end="01:39:40.159it to 10 and then it's going to create
1:39:36.880" end="01:39:41.679an email structure around that. And I
1:39:40.159" end="01:39:43.679will next like figure out how to do
1:39:41.679" end="01:39:45.840this. But what I first want to do is I
1:39:43.679" end="01:39:48.480want to have the ranked elements and
1:39:45.840" end="01:39:51.760then I wanted to give uh the agent
1:39:48.480" end="01:39:54.480should create an introduction summary to
1:39:51.760" end="01:39:58.560say the user like hey names for example

1:40:46.880" end="01:40:50.960ideally don't want to really create any
1:40:48.639" end="01:40:52.239external accounts or use paid services.
1:40:50.960" end="01:40:54.639I'm looking for the simplest way
1:40:52.239" end="01:40:56.239possible. If there's a really simple
1:40:54.639" end="01:40:57.679free solution that does require an
1:40:56.239" end="01:40:59.520account, let me know. I just don't want
1:40:57.679" end="01:41:01.440to overengineer things. I already have

1:41:03.679" end="01:41:11.040how we do it. So now we let this run on
1:41:07.199" end="01:41:16.880the GBT new GPT 5.1 model. Come back
1:41:11.040" end="01:41:19.440over here. We have our email agent which
1:41:16.880" end="01:41:21.679look. So this is now going to get
1:41:19.440" end="01:41:23.360greetings introduction.
1:41:21.679" end="01:41:27.040Yeah, we should also have the user

1:41:55.440" end="01:41:59.360based on the hours. That's good. Then we
1:41:57.760" end="01:42:01.040do rank. Yeah. Okay. So, we do the
1:41:59.360" end="01:42:04.239ranking in this as well because it needs

1:43:05.600" end="01:43:10.639essentially creating I want that to be a
1:43:07.760" end="01:43:12.000pientic model and so with the
1:43:10.639" end="01:43:15.040introduction greeting introduction
1:43:12.000" end="01:43:17.360articles total rank top end that's good
1:43:15.040" end="01:43:19.679and then maybe I've missed it but is the
1:43:17.360" end="01:43:22.480URL also in here because I want to have
1:43:19.679" end="01:43:25.600the the title and then the short little
1:43:22.480" end="01:43:29.199summary but then also I want the I want

1:43:34.320" end="01:43:38.159list. So you got the top 10 articles. I
1:43:36.480" end="01:43:39.760don't want it
1:43:38.159" end="01:43:42.080to be the list. I want it to be with
1:43:39.760" end="01:43:44.080sections and headers. So we can then
1:43:42.080" end="01:43:49.520convert it into an actual nice readable
1:43:44.080" end="01:43:53.280format. Make sure to push this.
1:43:49.520" end="01:43:56.320And let's give this one more spin. This
1:43:53.280" end="01:43:57.600baby. So okay, this is going right now.
1:43:56.320" end="01:43:59.280Everything running. Okay, let's get back
1:43:57.600" end="01:44:01.520to GPT.
1:43:59.280" end="01:44:03.920What we want to do? Use your e existing
1:44:01.520" end="01:44:06.159email account. Okay, this is usually the
1:44:03.920" end="01:44:09.360simplest real solution. Python has an
1:44:06.159" end="01:44:11.440SMTP lip. How does it work with Gmail?
1:44:09.360" end="01:44:13.440Using an app password. You have Gmail
1:44:11.440" end="01:44:16.080account to FS on. You create an app
1:44:13.440" end="01:44:18.320password in your Google account. Let's
1:44:16.080" end="01:44:20.080see if this works. I've never done
1:44:18.320" end="01:44:22.639something like this. I've used plenty of
1:44:20.080" end="01:44:24.719email providers. All right. So, let's
1:44:22.639" end="01:44:26.800actually see if this works. I created
1:44:24.719" end="01:44:28.639some environment variables and I was
1:44:26.800" end="01:44:31.199just googling how do you create an app
1:44:28.639" end="01:44:33.199password. Apparently you need your per
1:44:31.199" end="01:44:35.040you need a personal Gmail account for
1:44:33.199" end="01:44:37.440this. So I'm just like just going to
1:44:35.040" end="01:44:40.719follow along. So it's going to be the AI
1:44:37.440" end="01:44:42.400news agent that's going to send uh let's
1:44:40.719" end="01:44:44.880see I'm going to quickly switch over
1:44:42.400" end="01:44:47.679here and create it because yeah now I
1:44:44.880" end="01:44:49.840see a beautiful password on the screen.
1:44:47.679" end="01:44:52.000I'm going to
1:44:49.840" end="01:44:56.159copy that. Let's see. And I'm going to
1:44:52.000" end="01:44:59.199plug that into my environment variables.
1:44:56.159" end="01:45:03.600Let's see. Let's do it like this. Okay.
1:44:59.199" end="01:45:05.679Close it out. Okay. So, let's see. I I
1:45:03.600" end="01:45:07.920updated the example that ENV. So, you
1:45:05.679" end="01:45:11.119have my email app password. And again, I
1:45:07.920" end="01:45:13.280have no idea if this works. So,
1:45:11.119" end="01:45:15.199this is in here. Let's actually come
1:45:13.280" end="01:45:20.719back. So, I have I have the AI news
1:45:15.199" end="01:45:22.639agent. Okay. So, send email. what what I
1:45:20.719" end="01:45:25.199can do
1:45:22.639" end="01:45:27.440what we do. So we do we do the login and
1:45:25.199" end="01:45:30.239then we do message.
1:45:27.440" end="01:45:32.159Yeah. Okay. So I do from my email to my
1:45:30.239" end="01:45:35.040email. So that's good. So I'm sending it
1:45:32.159" end="01:45:37.199to myself. Test from Python.
1:45:35.040" end="01:45:40.560Does does this actually work? Does it
1:45:37.199" end="01:45:45.040work like this? App password
1:45:40.560" end="01:45:48.333key error. It's brackets.
1:45:45.040" end="01:45:50.000We need we need like this parenthesis.
1:45:48.333" end="01:45:52.880[clears throat]
1:45:50.000" end="01:45:55.360Did I mess up something? Oh, wait. I'm
1:45:52.880" end="01:45:59.440just completely like this is what we
1:45:55.360" end="01:46:02.239need. CHGBT giving me weird
1:45:59.440" end="01:46:05.679information here. Okay, we got a weird
1:46:02.239" end="01:46:09.360little response error. What's this?
1:46:05.679" end="01:46:12.400Okay, this doesn't seem to be as easy.
1:46:09.360" end="01:46:13.840Okay, let's actually have a look at this
1:46:12.400" end="01:46:15.360example over here. I found the blog
1:46:13.840" end="01:46:19.119post. How to send emails in Python with
1:46:15.360" end="01:46:23.119Gmail SNP API. Now, I'm just going to
1:46:19.119" end="01:46:25.840pretty much say, look, follow this
1:46:23.119" end="01:46:27.840guide. Yeah. Okay. So, this is this is a
1:46:25.840" end="01:46:29.920new one for me. So, like I said, quick
1:46:27.840" end="01:46:31.760side step. So, for a lot of tools and
1:46:29.920" end="01:46:34.719and and products that we have, we use
1:46:31.760" end="01:46:36.639resend is a really nice tool where you
1:46:34.719" end="01:46:38.159can programmatically set up email if you
1:46:36.639" end="01:46:39.679want to do it more professionally. Right
1:46:38.159" end="01:46:41.119now, I don't care about that and I don't
1:46:39.679" end="01:46:43.040want to create another account for this,
1:46:41.119" end="01:46:46.080but that's just a little little side
1:46:43.040" end="01:46:48.080note. So let's see what what we're
1:46:46.080" end="01:46:53.360coming up with.
1:46:48.080" end="01:46:56.320Okay, so it has the whole HTML config in
1:46:53.360" end="01:46:59.760there. Is that also in the guide? We got
1:46:56.320" end="01:47:01.760send emails. So this with SMTP, send
1:46:59.760" end="01:47:04.400emails to multiple recipients. Send
1:47:01.760" end="01:47:07.040attachments. Send HTML. Okay, but this
1:47:04.400" end="01:47:11.040is good because we need this.
1:47:07.040" end="01:47:15.280Okay, usage. What do we do?
1:47:11.040" end="01:47:16.880Process email. Did it already? It's go.
1:47:15.280" end="01:47:19.280It's definitely getting ahead of itself
1:47:16.880" end="01:47:22.080because we first actually need to test
1:47:19.280" end="01:47:26.400whether this is working. Markdown. That
1:47:22.080" end="01:47:31.040is Is that a dependency that we have?
1:47:26.400" end="01:47:32.960Probably need to install that. UV add
1:47:31.040" end="01:47:36.560markdown.
1:47:32.960" end="01:47:40.400Markdown. Sure to spell that right.
1:47:36.560" end="01:47:42.639Okay. Do you think this will Do you
1:47:40.400" end="01:47:45.440think this will run right now?
1:47:42.639" end="01:47:47.679Still not. All right. Did a little bit
1:47:45.440" end="01:47:50.239of tinkering and I noticed that I was
1:47:47.679" end="01:47:52.000running the email from within the root
1:47:50.239" end="01:47:54.639and not from within the app folder where
1:47:52.000" end="01:47:56.239the environment variables live. So it
1:47:54.639" end="01:47:59.040added a little bit more validation in
1:47:56.239" end="01:48:01.119here. But fingers crossed. And now the
1:47:59.040" end="01:48:05.360moment of truth.
1:48:01.119" end="01:48:08.400It worked. Test from Python. Let's go.
1:48:05.360" end="01:48:10.480Hello from my script. Okay, so this is
1:48:08.400" end="01:48:14.639actually very simple. So you need a
1:48:10.480" end="01:48:16.000personal Gmail account and then you need
1:48:14.639" end="01:48:18.560to get the app password and that's
1:48:16.000" end="01:48:21.840literally all you need to do. So again
1:48:18.560" end="01:48:23.520in the example env my email app
1:48:21.840" end="01:48:26.000password. Make sure to get that in
1:48:23.520" end="01:48:29.520there. Let's just let's just first do
1:48:26.000" end="01:48:31.920checkin. We need we need a checkin with
1:48:29.520" end="01:48:33.679a commit. And now I'm going to actually
1:48:31.920" end="01:48:36.000say
1:48:33.679" end="01:48:38.960okay awesome. I just validated sending
1:48:36.000" end="01:48:41.360the email in email.py. Please have a
1:48:38.960" end="01:48:44.320look at that file and make sure that the
1:48:41.360" end="01:48:47.760process email implementation is actually
1:48:44.320" end="01:48:51.199correctly implemented and then take the
1:48:47.760" end="01:48:53.760take the whole output that was created
1:48:51.199" end="01:48:56.880and then structure the HTML in such a
1:48:53.760" end="01:48:58.880way that we get a minimal style. So
1:48:56.880" end="01:49:00.639don't go crazy in there. Just do small
1:48:58.880" end="01:49:02.560small headings, bold text, maybe some
1:49:00.639" end="01:49:05.760italics and the links in there, but that
1:49:02.560" end="01:49:08.639we get the perfect digest email.
1:49:05.760" end="01:49:11.440This is going to be fun.
1:49:08.639" end="01:49:14.159Because now the email agent
1:49:11.440" end="01:49:15.679we need to give it the capabilities I
1:49:14.159" end="01:49:17.920think
1:49:15.679" end="01:49:20.400to send the email or is that what was
1:49:17.920" end="01:49:23.360that process email? So we have that in
1:49:20.400" end="01:49:26.000there. What's this? I don't like this
1:49:23.360" end="01:49:29.520email module path.
1:49:26.000" end="01:49:31.440We're creating a Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
1:49:29.520" end="01:49:36.000We definitely need to move this
1:49:31.440" end="01:49:38.239somewhere else. But it's going crazy.
1:49:36.000" end="01:49:40.400Okay. That was a lot. Let's keep
1:49:38.239" end="01:49:42.800everything. So, this is good. Okay, this
1:49:40.400" end="01:49:45.440is good. But I don't want the email.py
1:49:42.800" end="01:49:47.920to live in the root of the app folder.
1:49:45.440" end="01:49:51.760What would be the best place to put
1:49:47.920" end="01:49:53.840this? Think about the structure there.
1:49:51.760" end="01:49:56.960So, this is just a tiny thing in here,
1:49:53.840" end="01:49:59.360but like I said, I don't I don't You
1:49:56.960" end="01:50:00.960know what? No, stop. It's okay. It's
1:49:59.360" end="01:50:02.960okay. I don't want to over complicate
1:50:00.960" end="01:50:05.600things for now. We also have the runner.
1:50:02.960" end="01:50:07.280We have the We'll do a refactoring
1:50:05.600" end="01:50:11.119later. This This is all good. Let's
1:50:07.280" end="01:50:15.600first check if it works. Wait. So now
1:50:11.119" end="01:50:17.199what can we do? Can we send email?
1:50:15.600" end="01:50:19.440We don't need this one. We need to
1:50:17.199" end="01:50:21.520process email. Yeah. So we have all
1:50:19.440" end="01:50:23.199this. So we get the email module, which
1:50:21.520" end="01:50:27.360is a little bit weird that we imported
1:50:23.199" end="01:50:29.520from that, but like I've said, we do
1:50:27.360" end="01:50:32.639send email
1:50:29.520" end="01:50:37.360first. We generate it and then we send
1:50:32.639" end="01:50:39.600it. There's a big very big IC. We have
1:50:37.360" end="01:50:44.400the main functionality and then we have
1:50:39.600" end="01:50:47.600a whole lot of information here.
1:50:44.400" end="01:50:49.840I definitely don't like this but
1:50:47.600" end="01:50:52.400let's try it first
1:50:49.840" end="01:50:54.400and then we'll do a big refactoring. So
1:50:52.400" end="01:50:57.679now first what it will do remember right
1:50:54.400" end="01:50:59.679it will pull the digests that we already
1:50:57.679" end="01:51:01.760created. So these are persisted. That's
1:50:59.679" end="01:51:03.360nice. We have that in the database. It's
1:51:01.760" end="01:51:05.440going to pull that from the last 24
1:51:03.360" end="01:51:07.840hours, which in this case is everything.
1:51:05.440" end="01:51:09.520It's going to rank them. So that's what
1:51:07.840" end="01:51:12.080it's doing right now. It's ranking the
1:51:09.520" end="01:51:14.00012 digest emails. Look. So now and now
1:51:12.080" end="01:51:16.400it's going to generate the email judgest
1:51:14.000" end="01:51:18.480with top 10 articles. It's doing that.
1:51:16.400" end="01:51:20.719So it's creating the Oh, it send it
1:51:18.480" end="01:51:22.320already. So now it it first does the
1:51:20.719" end="01:51:24.639introduction and then it formats
1:51:22.320" end="01:51:27.840everything. Okay. Now I'm very This is
1:51:24.639" end="01:51:31.360This is the moment of truth, guys. Let's
1:51:27.840" end="01:51:35.199Daily AI news digest. Yes, this is so
1:51:31.360" end="01:51:38.080cool. This is good. This is good. It
1:51:35.199" end="01:51:41.280links to videos, dude. This is like This
1:51:38.080" end="01:51:43.280is a product. I may I might even sell
1:51:41.280" end="01:51:45.760this. Okay, it has like Hey, Dave.
1:51:43.280" end="01:51:48.480Here's It starts a little bit bigger and
1:51:45.760" end="01:51:51.760we have the links to the work.
1:51:48.480" end="01:51:54.000You got the robo-dog again. This is
1:51:51.760" end="01:51:56.239really, really good. But we're there.
1:51:54.000" end="01:51:58.480This is literally it. Now we just need
1:51:56.239" end="01:52:02.080to deploy this and make sure we run this
1:51:58.480" end="01:52:06.719every 24 hours. That's so cool. So,
1:52:02.080" end="01:52:09.119okay, let's let's quickly store this.
1:52:06.719" end="01:52:10.800Okay, perfect. This is all working. What
1:52:09.119" end="01:52:14.000I now want you to do is I want you to do
1:52:10.800" end="01:52:17.199a final review of the app folder and the
1:52:14.000" end="01:52:20.800structure in there and potentially
1:52:17.199" end="01:52:26.800refactor the where the email.py pi is
1:52:20.800" end="01:52:29.840and how we import that into into the
1:52:26.800" end="01:52:31.440what is it into the process email. I
1:52:29.840" end="01:52:34.080don't like that. I also don't really
1:52:31.440" end="01:52:36.639like the big in the process email there
1:52:34.080" end="01:52:39.040is a very large piece of code under the
1:52:36.639" end="01:52:41.280if name equals main. I don't like that.
1:52:39.040" end="01:52:45.840And now given that we have the whole
1:52:41.280" end="01:52:48.400pipeline, can you generate now a single
1:52:45.840" end="01:52:50.080runner that would be that we could
1:52:48.400" end="01:52:51.520schedule every day where we bring
1:52:50.080" end="01:52:54.239everything together. So remember the
1:52:51.520" end="01:52:56.320pipeline, right? It's first getting all
1:52:54.239" end="01:52:58.159of the articles, putting it into the
1:52:56.320" end="01:53:00.239database, then creating the summaries,
1:52:58.159" end="01:53:01.760and then sending you digest email. So
1:53:00.239" end="01:53:04.080now I want to bring everything together
1:53:01.760" end="01:53:06.239in a single file that we can run. Let's
1:53:04.080" end="01:53:08.000do that. This is good. Okay, we got
1:53:06.239" end="01:53:10.719everything. So let's also see we got
1:53:08.000" end="01:53:13.440this main. I think it will override this
1:53:10.719" end="01:53:15.360because now this let's see this runner.
1:53:13.440" end="01:53:17.520Yeah, there we go. We get rid of the
1:53:15.360" end="01:53:19.280email. We put that here. Okay, it's is
1:53:17.520" end="01:53:21.920it the surface?
1:53:19.280" end="01:53:24.159Now we're creating the daily runner. I
1:53:21.920" end="01:53:25.679like that. I like that. So yeah, now
1:53:24.159" end="01:53:28.639this is this is what we want, right?
1:53:25.679" end="01:53:31.199We're going to do we're going to do the
1:53:28.639" end="01:53:35.280whole whole shebang
1:53:31.199" end="01:53:38.560updating the root for easier execution.
1:53:35.280" end="01:53:41.119So we have that. This is good. This is
1:53:38.560" end="01:53:43.040good. This is good. [clears throat]
1:53:41.119" end="01:53:44.880Okay. So we did a we did some
1:53:43.040" end="01:53:47.679refactoring.
1:53:44.880" end="01:53:49.840Uh oh I should have ended a
1:53:47.679" end="01:53:53.119message there. So let's push this one
1:53:49.840" end="01:53:56.239more time. Commit and push. So we have
1:53:53.119" end="01:53:58.400the main. So we can run this.
1:53:56.239" end="01:54:00.800I'm actually going to get rid of this.
1:53:58.400" end="01:54:03.040Don't need this. Let's just keep it in
1:54:00.800" end="01:54:05.199here. If we schedule this, this might be
1:54:03.040" end="01:54:08.000useful. Okay. So now let's do final
1:54:05.199" end="01:54:10.880check. So we have the
1:54:08.000" end="01:54:12.960service, we have the email in here,
1:54:10.880" end="01:54:14.800which is okay.
1:54:12.960" end="01:54:17.760Okay. Okay. Okay. What I'm now going to
1:54:14.800" end="01:54:18.960do is I'm going to You know what? I'm
1:54:17.760" end="01:54:21.920just going to get rid of everything,
1:54:18.960" end="01:54:24.719which we we just get rid of everything
1:54:21.920" end="01:54:26.080because I want to 100% know that
1:54:24.719" end="01:54:27.920everything is working. So I'm going to
1:54:26.080" end="01:54:31.440do create tables and I'm going to do
1:54:27.920" end="01:54:37.040this tables created. There we have the
1:54:31.440" end="01:54:39.679tables. And now I'm going to run this.
1:54:37.040" end="01:54:41.360Is this
1:54:39.679" end="01:54:44.239Is this running? Yeah, there we go.
1:54:41.360" end="01:54:46.320There we go. Okay. So, it's it's first
1:54:44.239" end="01:54:48.960uh get doing all the scraping. That goes
1:54:46.320" end="01:54:51.840pretty fast. So, we got our YouTube
1:54:48.960" end="01:54:54.639videos. We got those again. We got Let's
1:54:51.840" end="01:54:56.639see. We got entropic articles.
1:54:54.639" end="01:54:59.040We got no OpenAI articles because we do
1:54:56.639" end="01:55:01.92024 hours. We do. We did the 24 hours.
1:54:59.040" end="01:55:03.599That's the thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So,
1:55:01.920" end="01:55:06.480there's actually there's actually this
1:55:03.599" end="01:55:08.800is literally just released, isn't it?
1:55:06.480" end="01:55:10.560This is literally while I was recording
1:55:08.800" end="01:55:14.000this is this is published and we already
1:55:10.560" end="01:55:15.280catch it. Maryland partnership. This is
1:55:14.000" end="01:55:19.679how cool it is. I have no idea what this
1:55:15.280" end="01:55:22.239is about, but still. And it's Oh, we
1:55:19.679" end="01:55:25.119have our new daily just it's working.
1:55:22.239" end="01:55:27.599Email sent. So, this is now a lot less
1:55:25.119" end="01:55:30.320because we just did the 24 hours, right?
1:55:27.599" end="01:55:32.159Um, we just did the 24 hours. The thing
1:55:30.320" end="01:55:34.960is before we had more, right? Because
1:55:32.159" end="01:55:38.239that I I did a wider range. I did like
1:55:34.960" end="01:55:40.880150 hours. But the daily digests the the
1:55:38.239" end="01:55:44.800UU ID is from the day you created it.
1:55:40.880" end="01:55:46.719But since we already since we run it on
1:55:44.800" end="01:55:51.360a daily basis, it doesn't really matter
1:55:46.719" end="01:55:54.000as much. But still, it would be better
1:55:51.360" end="01:55:56.880to have it would be better to have the
1:55:54.000" end="01:55:58.400actual dates in there. Awesome. And this
1:55:56.880" end="01:56:00.560all works. I want to do one small
1:55:58.400" end="01:56:05.920refactoring. When we are creating the
1:56:00.560" end="01:56:08.719digest the created at field, I want that
1:56:05.920" end="01:56:11.280to be the original
1:56:08.719" end="01:56:14.639I want that to be the original date of
1:56:11.280" end="01:56:17.280the article itself because if we catch a
1:56:14.639" end="01:56:19.360because right now if you do a daily
1:56:17.280" end="01:56:21.280digest for let's say two weeks, they all
1:56:19.360" end="01:56:23.280have the same they all have the same
1:56:21.280" end="01:56:26.080date. Does that make sense? What's the
1:56:23.280" end="01:56:27.520easiest way to fix that? or should we
1:56:26.080" end="01:56:31.760maybe add another column and then use
1:56:27.520" end="01:56:34.159that for the filtering to get the digest
1:56:31.760" end="01:56:36.159from the 20 last 24 hours? That's now
1:56:34.159" end="01:56:38.080what we need to think about. So it's
1:56:36.159" end="01:56:42.320going to check
1:56:38.080" end="01:56:46.000use article published ads.
1:56:42.320" end="01:56:47.599Yeah. Okay. I'm just for the sake of
1:56:46.000" end="01:56:50.880demonstration, I'm just going to get rid
1:56:47.599" end="01:56:52.400of everything one more time. Fine time
1:56:50.880" end="01:56:56.000zones.
1:56:52.400" end="01:56:57.920Okay. Okay, going a little bit crazy.
1:56:56.000" end="01:56:59.760When a digest is created, created add is
1:56:57.920" end="01:57:03.040set to the dark article's original
1:56:59.760" end="01:57:06.320publish date. That's good. That's good.
1:57:03.040" end="01:57:10.800That's good. That's what I want because
1:57:06.320" end="01:57:13.599now what we can do is
1:57:10.800" end="01:57:15.599let's say
1:57:13.599" end="01:57:17.760do we want to have that in the email as
1:57:15.599" end="01:57:19.599well? We could later add that since we
1:57:17.760" end="01:57:22.239want to run it every 24 hours. Right now
1:57:19.599" end="01:57:26.239it doesn't really matter as much. So
1:57:22.239" end="01:57:29.760let's see for now what I want to do.
1:57:26.239" end="01:57:33.520I want to go to database create tables.
1:57:29.760" end="01:57:36.880Create a tables again. And now I want to
1:57:33.520" end="01:57:39.920run this one more time. There we go.
1:57:36.880" end="01:57:43.280Getting all of the transcripts.
1:57:39.920" end="01:57:46.400Starting digesting the articles.
1:57:43.280" end="01:57:50.320Actually get rid of this. And then now
1:57:46.400" end="01:57:52.080generating sending three digests.
1:57:50.320" end="01:57:54.400So, it goes a lot quicker because
1:57:52.080" end="01:57:57.199there's not we only have three digests
1:57:54.400" end="01:57:59.599from the last 24 hours. It works. It
1:57:57.199" end="01:58:01.599works good. You get the idea, right? We
1:57:59.599" end="01:58:04.080have all of the information. So, it
1:58:01.599" end="01:58:07.040would now be super simple to also extend
1:58:04.080" end="01:58:08.719this. Um, and I have a lot of exciting
1:58:07.040" end="01:58:10.159stuff that I can do with it, but I want
1:58:08.719" end="01:58:13.920to show you the final piece of the
1:58:10.159" end="01:58:16.639puzzle. We're going to do it because
1:58:13.920" end="01:58:21.440we we want to we want to actually deploy
1:58:16.639" end="01:58:24.159this so it runs. So, let's see. Do we
1:58:21.440" end="01:58:26.560have Are we good? Yes, we're good on
1:58:24.159" end="01:58:28.560this side. And then I'm going to say,
1:58:26.560" end="01:58:31.199okay, every awesome everything now
1:58:28.560" end="01:58:33.920works. How what would now be the
1:58:31.199" end="01:58:36.080simplest way to
1:58:33.920" end="01:58:37.679put this on a server something like I'm
1:58:36.080" end="01:58:40.880considering render but I'm not sure if
1:58:37.679" end="01:58:43.440it's the best one to package this and
1:58:40.880" end="01:58:46.639deploy it where we have the database
1:58:43.440" end="01:58:49.599deployed as well and within the docker
1:58:46.639" end="01:58:53.360container and we schedule the main.py
1:58:49.599" end="01:58:56.080file to run every 24 hours. First let's
1:58:53.360" end="01:58:58.560create a plan to do this. Let's actually
1:58:56.080" end="01:59:00.239get back to planning mode because I
1:58:58.560" end="01:59:02.400there's so many ways to do this, right?
1:59:00.239" end="01:59:04.880So, I'm I'm just trying to see like what
1:59:02.400" end="01:59:07.760what a quick quick and easy way to do
1:59:04.880" end="01:59:09.599this is. Okay, so it came up with a
1:59:07.760" end="01:59:11.119plan. This is going to get tricky, but
1:59:09.599" end="01:59:12.960we'll we'll see what we can do here.
1:59:11.119" end="01:59:15.599I've never worked with render, so I know
1:59:12.960" end="01:59:17.599that render just an easy way where you
1:59:15.599" end="01:59:20.719you employ this deploy stuff, but of
1:59:17.599" end="01:59:22.800course, every cloud provider still has
1:59:20.719" end="01:59:25.679its own like nuances there. But we have
1:59:22.800" end="01:59:27.119a solid we have a solid plan. So, I'm
1:59:25.679" end="01:59:28.719first going to ask a couple of things
1:59:27.119" end="01:59:33.760and then I'm definitely going to check
1:59:28.719" end="01:59:36.400out a new branch. And let's see what do
1:59:33.760" end="01:59:38.080I first need to set up in render. I I I
1:59:36.400" end="01:59:41.119can create an account, but do I first
1:59:38.080" end="01:59:43.679need to set up a managed surface using
1:59:41.119" end="01:59:47.040Postgress SQL or can we all manage that
1:59:43.679" end="01:59:48.480from within the gaml the geml file that
1:59:47.040" end="01:59:51.280we create? How does that work with
1:59:48.480" end="01:59:53.199render? Okay, so I need a little bit
1:59:51.280" end="01:59:57.360more clarity there and then we can get
1:59:53.199" end="01:59:58.960into the deployment.
1:59:57.360" end="02:00:00.320This is probably the moment that I'm
1:59:58.960" end="02:00:02.320going to switch to another branch
2:00:00.320" end="02:00:04.719because this is now working locally.
2:00:02.320" end="02:00:06.800Let's see. Option one, define everything
2:00:04.719" end="02:00:10.400in render. That's okay. Beautiful. I
2:00:06.800" end="02:00:14.400want to do that. Okay, here we go, boys.
2:00:10.400" end="02:00:17.840Here we go. Okay, perfect. Then let's
2:00:14.400" end="02:00:20.000execute on the plan as is. I'm going to
2:00:17.840" end="02:00:21.760create an account. walk me through this
2:00:20.000" end="02:00:24.320step by step and start working on the
2:00:21.760" end="02:00:27.119code already. But before you do that, I
2:00:24.320" end="02:00:30.480want you to switch to another branch
2:00:27.119" end="02:00:32.880called deployment and
2:00:30.480" end="02:00:34.560work on the changes there. All right, so
2:00:32.880" end="02:00:38.000let's do that first and then start
2:00:34.560" end="02:00:40.400implementing everything. Okay, so let's
2:00:38.000" end="02:00:42.320give this a shot. Get started. I'm not
2:00:40.400" end="02:00:45.199even sure if I already have an account.
2:00:42.320" end="02:00:47.679I'm just going to authenticate with
2:00:45.199" end="02:00:49.199Google over here. Create the account.
2:00:47.679" end="02:00:51.280And by the way guys, you should you can
2:00:49.199" end="02:00:53.679also totally like stop here with this
2:00:51.280" end="02:00:55.360video and just like run it yourself or
2:00:53.679" end="02:00:58.159schedule it on your laptop or some type
2:00:55.360" end="02:01:00.239of other machine. But I let's see what
2:00:58.159" end="02:01:02.560we have. We have a workspace. I just
2:01:00.239" end="02:01:03.920want to Yes. Okay. I have an account
2:01:02.560" end="02:01:06.400already. I started playing with
2:01:03.920" end="02:01:08.880something some time ago. Okay, good. So
2:01:06.400" end="02:01:10.560let's see what I need to do in here. Are
2:01:08.880" end="02:01:12.480we on the deployment branch? We are on
2:01:10.560" end="02:01:14.960the deployment branch. Yeah, that's
2:01:12.480" end="02:01:19.280good. We have a Docker file updating the
2:01:14.960" end="02:01:21.520database connection. So now we need to
2:01:19.280" end="02:01:23.679we open a API key. We have this and then
2:01:21.520" end="02:01:25.520we have the database configuration for
2:01:23.679" end="02:01:28.880render database user automatically
2:01:25.520" end="02:01:30.960provided. No need to set individual vss.
2:01:28.880" end="02:01:33.679Yeah. Okay.
2:01:30.960" end="02:01:36.719Jeez this is going fast. Okay. What do I
2:01:33.679" end="02:01:38.560need to do? Deployment. Okay. Deployment
2:01:36.719" end="02:01:40.880guide render. What do I need to do? I
2:01:38.560" end="02:01:44.480have the account. GitHub account with
2:01:40.880" end="02:01:46.560this repository API key. Gmail account.
2:01:44.480" end="02:01:49.360Yeah, we got that. We have the account.
2:01:46.560" end="02:01:51.040Verify email address. Click new
2:01:49.360" end="02:01:54.639blueprint. Connect your GitHub account
2:01:51.040" end="02:01:56.880if not already connected. Blueprints.
2:01:54.639" end="02:01:59.119Create a new blueprints instant. Connect
2:01:56.880" end="02:02:02.639a repository. Look, there we go. We're
2:01:59.119" end="02:02:05.840going to connect our AI news aggregator.
2:02:02.639" end="02:02:08.800Blueprint name AI. Yeah, AI news
2:02:05.840" end="02:02:11.040aggregator. Let's just keep that branch.
2:02:08.800" end="02:02:13.360We're going to do Wait, wait, wait.
2:02:11.040" end="02:02:16.560We're going to
2:02:13.360" end="02:02:18.639push all of this. I need Yeah, the
2:02:16.560" end="02:02:20.800deployment branch is in here right now.
2:02:18.639" end="02:02:23.800And we're going to call this AI news
2:02:20.800" end="02:02:23.800aggregator.
2:02:23.944" end="02:02:29.199[clears throat] There we go. And then
2:02:27.280" end="02:02:31.040render demo file was found, but there
2:02:29.199" end="02:02:35.040was an issue
2:02:31.040" end="02:02:38.080unknown type. Let's retry that. Let's
2:02:35.040" end="02:02:40.480just plug it in there and deploy. Select
2:02:38.080" end="02:02:43.679the branch deployment render will
2:02:40.480" end="02:02:45.599automatically connect it. Review it. So
2:02:43.679" end="02:02:46.719now let's see what the issue is because
2:02:45.599" end="02:02:48.400the thing is what we're doing right now
2:02:46.719" end="02:02:50.320is we have a deployment script over
2:02:48.400" end="02:02:52.400here. And this pretty much tells render
2:02:50.320" end="02:02:54.880what we need to do. But what is this
2:02:52.400" end="02:02:57.760psging?
2:02:54.880" end="02:03:01.440It should be PG. Well, let's change it
2:02:57.760" end="02:03:03.840to PG. Okay. Beautiful.
2:03:01.440" end="02:03:05.920And oh, what's that? It did another
2:03:03.840" end="02:03:07.840thing. Removing max connections not
2:03:05.920" end="02:03:10.159valid. Okay.
2:03:07.840" end="02:03:13.199Yes. So, pushing to the deployment
2:03:10.159" end="02:03:17.920branch. And now, let's see. We're going
2:03:13.199" end="02:03:20.560to retry this one more time. Hey, it's
2:03:17.920" end="02:03:23.520this. I don't like this stuff. Let's
2:03:20.560" end="02:03:25.679actually give it give it the docs. It's
2:03:23.520" end="02:03:27.119also not PG. Please carefully look at
2:03:25.679" end="02:03:29.119the docs for the blueprint to figure out
2:03:27.119" end="02:03:32.159how to do this
2:03:29.119" end="02:03:35.040docker file. So, it created the
2:03:32.159" end="02:03:37.920requirements based on the Pi project.
2:03:35.040" end="02:03:40.159And here you can see AI is also like
2:03:37.920" end="02:03:42.159venturing pretty much in the unknown,
2:03:40.159" end="02:03:45.440right? Because this is a relatively
2:03:42.159" end="02:03:48.000newer surface and it's you can see it's
2:03:45.440" end="02:03:49.760not well trained on this. So that's why
2:03:48.000" end="02:03:52.719we really specifically need to give it
2:03:49.760" end="02:03:54.159the documentation in order to loop that
2:03:52.719" end="02:03:56.560up. But this is literally one of the
2:03:54.159" end="02:03:58.159things it could it could still be wrong
2:03:56.560" end="02:04:01.280right now. The the and these can be
2:03:58.159" end="02:04:03.920really tricky loops to figure out. This
2:04:01.280" end="02:04:05.840should work. Fingers crossed. It is
2:04:03.920" end="02:04:08.000definitely different from from what it
2:04:05.840" end="02:04:12.080was. This
2:04:08.000" end="02:04:14.000that's good. Let's retry this.
2:04:12.080" end="02:04:15.679It works. It works. It works. Okay. So,
2:04:14.000" end="02:04:17.599now we need to Oh, this is cool. So, now
2:04:15.679" end="02:04:19.040we need to plug in the variable. So,
2:04:17.599" end="02:04:21.760what I'm going to do right now, you're
2:04:19.040" end="02:04:24.880going to have to look at me once more
2:04:21.760" end="02:04:27.760while I plug in the keys. And so, I'm
2:04:24.880" end="02:04:30.159going to put in the email. Yes. Which is
2:04:27.760" end="02:04:32.000not that secret. And then we have the
2:04:30.159" end="02:04:35.840password.
2:04:32.000" end="02:04:40.080And then we have the open AI API key.
2:04:35.840" end="02:04:41.920Let's see. Yes. Okay. Back to the
2:04:40.080" end="02:04:43.840screen. So that's everything is in
2:04:41.920" end="02:04:45.599there. And we're going to do deploy
2:04:43.840" end="02:04:48.159blueprint.
2:04:45.599" end="02:04:50.960Okay. Okay. Okay.
2:04:48.159" end="02:04:53.840Looking good so far.
2:04:50.960" end="02:04:55.520So let's actually So what what what is
2:04:53.840" end="02:04:58.480actually happening in so in the docker
2:04:55.520" end="02:05:01.280file? This will probably tell us what it
2:04:58.480" end="02:05:02.960will do. So,
2:05:01.280" end="02:05:05.520do we already have where where's the
2:05:02.960" end="02:05:06.800scheduling in here? Oh, sorry. Wait. We
2:05:05.520" end="02:05:09.440have the deployment guide. I need to
2:05:06.800" end="02:05:11.679follow the deployment guide. So, review.
2:05:09.440" end="02:05:15.040So, this will
2:05:11.679" end="02:05:18.639daily digest job. Where is this? Render
2:05:15.040" end="02:05:21.199will read. Is it Is it in here? It's in
2:05:18.639" end="02:05:22.800here. This is the Okay, I get it. So,
2:05:21.199" end="02:05:25.440we're configuring the server. We have
2:05:22.800" end="02:05:27.760the database and we have a surface which
2:05:25.440" end="02:05:30.159is chron job. It's called daily digest
2:05:27.760" end="02:05:33.119job. And here's what we do. We have the
2:05:30.159" end="02:05:36.320Docker file. We schedule that. We do it.
2:05:33.119" end="02:05:38.000And then we do Python main.py.
2:05:36.320" end="02:05:40.960And these are the environment variables.
2:05:38.000" end="02:05:44.159And then we simply just run this. It I
2:05:40.960" end="02:05:47.199It's going pretty smooth so far. If this
2:05:44.159" end="02:05:51.440literally deploys and works on the first
2:05:47.199" end="02:05:54.480try, then heads off to composer one.
2:05:51.440" end="02:05:56.960Literally. We got the green check. We
2:05:54.480" end="02:06:00.320got the green check. So, we have a
2:05:56.960" end="02:06:01.679deployment. I think this is it. So far,
2:06:00.320" end="02:06:03.920like I have no idea how this works. So,
2:06:01.679" end="02:06:05.199we have projects, blueprints. I I don't
2:06:03.920" end="02:06:06.880even know what the difference between a
2:06:05.199" end="02:06:09.280project and a blueprint is. It's an
2:06:06.880" end="02:06:10.800event. So, okay, let's let's see for
2:06:09.280" end="02:06:12.239what's going on over here because this
2:06:10.800" end="02:06:14.480is actually going to trigger the script
2:06:12.239" end="02:06:16.639for the first time. Okay. And then
2:06:14.480" end="02:06:18.480quickly while we wait for this to run,
2:06:16.639" end="02:06:20.639let's also check how you can actually
2:06:18.480" end="02:06:22.400connect to your database. So, if you
2:06:20.639" end="02:06:25.119let's come to renderover. If you go to
2:06:22.400" end="02:06:26.800your blueprints, we have our AI news
2:06:25.119" end="02:06:29.920aggregator. So here you can see we have
2:06:26.800" end="02:06:32.320our job and we have our DB, right? If
2:06:29.920" end="02:06:33.840you scroll all the way down over here,
2:06:32.320" end="02:06:35.199this is where you can see your database
2:06:33.840" end="02:06:38.079credentials. So you have host name,
2:06:35.199" end="02:06:40.239port, database, username, and then also
2:06:38.079" end="02:06:42.480the password in here to connect with
2:06:40.239" end="02:06:43.920this. And then what you want to do, so
2:06:42.480" end="02:06:46.719the host name can be a little bit
2:06:43.920" end="02:06:48.159tricky, but what you actually want to do
2:06:46.719" end="02:06:50.079is you want to let's see, let me
2:06:48.159" end="02:06:51.599actually hide this so you can see my
2:06:50.079" end="02:06:53.840passwords. You want to click on the
2:06:51.599" end="02:06:55.679external database URL and you want to
2:06:53.840" end="02:06:58.079look at that and there you see a full
2:06:55.679" end="02:06:59.920URL in there. So this will be in here
2:06:58.079" end="02:07:02.000but it will also have your where it's
2:06:59.920" end="02:07:04.800deployed. So for example for me it's
2:07:02.000" end="02:07:06.639Oregon and then render.com. So that's
2:07:04.800" end="02:07:08.960the full information that you then need
2:07:06.639" end="02:07:10.800to need to use in order to for example
2:07:08.960" end="02:07:12.719put it into table plus. And I now
2:07:10.800" end="02:07:14.320successfully connected. Okay. Still
2:07:12.719" end="02:07:16.079trying to figure this out. It's taking
2:07:14.320" end="02:07:18.320really long. This scrunch job that we
2:07:16.079" end="02:07:20.320triggered here is still in process. I
2:07:18.320" end="02:07:23.840have no idea really what it's doing. I
2:07:20.320" end="02:07:25.679can't really see any logs right now. So,
2:07:23.840" end="02:07:26.880that is always really tricky when you're
2:07:25.679" end="02:07:28.880working with the new deployment
2:07:26.880" end="02:07:30.719platforms. I have to wrap up for the day
2:07:28.880" end="02:07:32.960literally. I'm just going to check back
2:07:30.719" end="02:07:35.199tomorrow and see if it actually if it
2:07:32.960" end="02:07:37.599actually did something and whether let's
2:07:35.199" end="02:07:40.560see this is still running where we have
2:07:37.599" end="02:07:42.639errors and yeah, I'll get back to you.
2:07:40.560" end="02:07:45.360All right. Good morning, guys. It's the
2:07:42.639" end="02:07:48.000next day as you can see over here. We're
2:07:45.360" end="02:07:50.320now Friday and I had a dinner last
2:07:48.000" end="02:07:52.880night. I really wanted to finish this,
2:07:50.320" end="02:07:54.560but it was taking a really long time to
2:07:52.880" end="02:07:57.520get the build done and then I eventually
2:07:54.560" end="02:08:00.239ran into an error and this is what was
2:07:57.520" end="02:08:03.360happening. So, I got the following email
2:08:00.239" end="02:08:07.199from render. Look, we have a server
2:08:03.360" end="02:08:09.679failure on the daily digest job. We ran
2:08:07.199" end="02:08:11.440out of memory. And that is because when
2:08:09.679" end="02:08:13.360I was trying to set this up here, you
2:08:11.440" end="02:08:15.840can see uh everything. When I was trying
2:08:13.360" end="02:08:19.520to set this up, if I go to the settings
2:08:15.840" end="02:08:23.119of this server really here, you can see
2:08:19.520" end="02:08:26.560that if I go all the way
2:08:23.119" end="02:08:29.199where is it over here, you can see the
2:08:26.560" end="02:08:32.079instance type currently was set to
2:08:29.199" end="02:08:35.280before it was starter and I've upgraded
2:08:32.079" end="02:08:37.360it to standard and that is because I did
2:08:35.280" end="02:08:40.639two things actually. I figured that
2:08:37.360" end="02:08:43.520dockling the library that we are using
2:08:40.639" end="02:08:47.040in order to oh that's not dockling
2:08:43.520" end="02:08:50.320dockling the library that we're using to
2:08:47.040" end="02:08:53.199extract or turn the HTML into markdown.
2:08:50.320" end="02:08:55.199That's quite a beefy library because
2:08:53.199" end="02:08:57.119behind the scenes it loads in a lot of
2:08:55.199" end="02:09:00.079like powerful local models that can also
2:08:57.119" end="02:09:02.480do OCR but that's not needed for this
2:09:00.079" end="02:09:05.840project. So that's why we were running
2:09:02.480" end="02:09:08.079out of memory. So I first just tried to
2:09:05.840" end="02:09:11.360update it to standard which is something
2:09:08.079" end="02:09:13.440you can also try to do but what I
2:09:11.360" end="02:09:16.159actually then did was like okay I think
2:09:13.440" end="02:09:19.440we can do a simpler approach here. So
2:09:16.159" end="02:09:22.880let's see coming back to our app then to
2:09:19.440" end="02:09:26.079our services and then to sorry where is
2:09:22.880" end="02:09:29.520it in our scrapers and in our entropic
2:09:26.079" end="02:09:32.800scraper you can see that I am now using
2:09:29.520" end="02:09:35.760a different library. Let's actually
2:09:32.800" end="02:09:38.800scroll up. We have HTML to markdown and
2:09:35.760" end="02:09:40.800this is a very lightweight
2:09:38.800" end="02:09:43.360library. It's written in it's written in
2:09:40.800" end="02:09:45.360Rust and this pretty much does the same
2:09:43.360" end="02:09:47.440thing. So then first through the request
2:09:45.360" end="02:09:49.440library we get the HTML and then this
2:09:47.440" end="02:09:51.440turns it into markdown. It doesn't work
2:09:49.440" end="02:09:53.840as good as dockling though. That's that
2:09:51.440" end="02:09:55.840I got I got to give you that. So pretty
2:09:53.840" end="02:09:58.880much what I did so I I imported the
2:09:55.840" end="02:10:01.520convert and then that's pretty much now
2:09:58.880" end="02:10:04.159what we do. So I validated this and it
2:10:01.520" end="02:10:06.239does work. But if we now I I'll give you
2:10:04.159" end="02:10:09.440an example in a bit. So later down the
2:10:06.239" end="02:10:11.760line I might just look into just the
2:10:09.440" end="02:10:13.520component that we need from dockling and
2:10:11.760" end="02:10:14.400put it into the project myself. So
2:10:13.520" end="02:10:16.320essentially we're going to take
2:10:14.400" end="02:10:18.719something out of the package and and put
2:10:16.320" end="02:10:20.560it here. So that's a quick little
2:10:18.719" end="02:10:23.280rundown. So what else did I do? So I
2:10:20.560" end="02:10:25.840removed dockling and upgraded surfer.
2:10:23.280" end="02:10:28.400Yeah. Okay. So that that worked. So then
2:10:25.840" end="02:10:30.800I was able to continue. Let me actually
2:10:28.400" end="02:10:32.880go. So that that's how we solved this
2:10:30.800" end="02:10:35.679error. Then I went ahead with the
2:10:32.880" end="02:10:38.960deployments. So you could see events. If
2:10:35.679" end="02:10:40.400I go into the the logs, you can see a
2:10:38.960" end="02:10:42.000stream of all the logs, everything
2:10:40.400" end="02:10:44.400that's going on on the server. So let me
2:10:42.000" end="02:10:46.400let me let me pull that up for you
2:10:44.400" end="02:10:48.560because this is part of the of the
2:10:46.400" end="02:10:51.599learning process. This is a big part of
2:10:48.560" end="02:10:54.639doing deployments to look at past logs
2:10:51.599" end="02:10:57.360and to debug that if it's loading. This
2:10:54.639" end="02:10:59.280is also why so sometimes working with
2:10:57.360" end="02:11:01.520these external surfaces can be a little
2:10:59.280" end="02:11:04.400bit tricky because now this just like is
2:11:01.520" end="02:11:06.639stuck over here. So why can I not see
2:11:04.400" end="02:11:09.840this right now? Well, that's just
2:11:06.639" end="02:11:11.920annoying. Just give me Wait, this
2:11:09.840" end="02:11:16.079probably my There we go. That's just my
2:11:11.920" end="02:11:19.360error. Okay, so let's see.
2:11:16.079" end="02:11:21.840So then what happens is when it did not
2:11:19.360" end="02:11:24.079run out of memory and it tried to it
2:11:21.840" end="02:11:25.840tried to deploy the pipeline it ran into
2:11:24.079" end="02:11:28.239errors one more time where the tables
2:11:25.840" end="02:11:30.239weren't properly created. So the tables
2:11:28.239" end="02:11:31.840here you can see for example it tried to
2:11:30.239" end="02:11:34.079perform an operation it says look
2:11:31.840" end="02:11:37.840YouTube videos that table doesn't exist
2:11:34.079" end="02:11:41.119yet. So before it was specified in the
2:11:37.840" end="02:11:44.480docker file. So we had I'm not sure no
2:11:41.119" end="02:11:46.239it's already we we ran the create tables
2:11:44.480" end="02:11:49.119in here as well. that can probably still
2:11:46.239" end="02:11:51.679work, but I I run into an issue. So, how
2:11:49.119" end="02:11:53.599we solve that essentially is in the run
2:11:51.679" end="02:11:58.000daily pipeline,
2:11:53.599" end="02:12:00.480you can now see that we also import the
2:11:58.000" end="02:12:03.840engine in here and then we perform a
2:12:00.480" end="02:12:06.639check to ensure that the data database
2:12:03.840" end="02:12:09.440tables exist. So, if the database tables
2:12:06.639" end="02:12:12.639aren't there, we manually create them in
2:12:09.440" end="02:12:14.719the daily runner. So, that's another
2:12:12.639" end="02:12:16.800little tweak that I had to do. And now
2:12:14.719" end="02:12:19.199let's see. This is just stuff that I
2:12:16.800" end="02:12:22.159still want to do. So now you're up to
2:12:19.199" end="02:12:25.760speed again. But the cool thing is this
2:12:22.159" end="02:12:29.360morning I woke up. Look, there it is.
2:12:25.760" end="02:12:32.239The daily AI news digest November 14th.
2:12:29.360" end="02:12:35.360Let's go. So I have this now in my
2:12:32.239" end="02:12:38.000inbox. So we made it end to end and it's
2:12:35.360" end="02:12:40.560now working on a render, which is super
2:12:38.000" end="02:12:42.159exciting. All right, so let's try and
2:12:40.560" end="02:12:44.000wrap up this project. Right now there
2:12:42.159" end="02:12:46.480are a couple of things that I still want
2:12:44.000" end="02:12:49.119to do. So first what I'm going to do is
2:12:46.480" end="02:12:52.239I'm going to actually I'm going to
2:12:49.119" end="02:12:54.800create a new branch. So let's actually
2:12:52.239" end="02:12:58.079see this. This this is all good. We can
2:12:54.800" end="02:13:00.239just get rid of this because why I am
2:12:58.079" end="02:13:01.760going to do this because I want you to
2:13:00.239" end="02:13:03.599follow along. So we're going to have the
2:13:01.760" end="02:13:05.520main branch, right? We just had the
2:13:03.599" end="02:13:08.400deployment branch but now what I'm going
2:13:05.520" end="02:13:11.520to do I'm going to do deployment final
2:13:08.400" end="02:13:13.760and then that Yeah. Okay. Wait. Git is
2:13:11.520" end="02:13:15.679always a little bit weird with that with
2:13:13.760" end="02:13:18.800slashes.
2:13:15.679" end="02:13:21.199Let's do deploy.
2:13:18.800" end="02:13:22.960Let's just use a dash deployment final.
2:13:21.199" end="02:13:25.040I thought it would be okay, but hey,
2:13:22.960" end="02:13:27.520it's not. Yeah, let's publish this
2:13:25.040" end="02:13:29.440branch. So now if I go to the
2:13:27.520" end="02:13:32.880repository,
2:13:29.440" end="02:13:35.679let's see. You can see, yeah, currently
2:13:32.880" end="02:13:38.239still private. So we have the master
2:13:35.679" end="02:13:40.480branch and then we have the deployment
2:13:38.239" end="02:13:42.239and the deployment final. And now what I
2:13:40.480" end="02:13:44.560need to do, I need to go back to render
2:13:42.239" end="02:13:47.360and I need to go into my settings and
2:13:44.560" end="02:13:50.400then we need to change the branch look.
2:13:47.360" end="02:13:53.360So here we can now
2:13:50.400" end="02:13:54.960we can edit this and look now we have
2:13:53.360" end="02:13:56.320the deployment final in here. So I'm
2:13:54.960" end="02:13:58.159going to say look this is the deployment
2:13:56.320" end="02:13:59.920branch. So whenever we push something to
2:13:58.159" end="02:14:03.119this branch
2:13:59.920" end="02:14:04.480that's when we want to trigger this. So
2:14:03.119" end="02:14:06.159I want to do all of the final changes
2:14:04.480" end="02:14:08.320and adjustments and really make it nice
2:14:06.159" end="02:14:11.920and neat. then put that into deployment
2:14:08.320" end="02:14:15.280final and then link that to render.
2:14:11.920" end="02:14:17.840And this way as you go through this, you
2:14:15.280" end="02:14:19.679can still follow along with everything
2:14:17.840" end="02:14:21.599that we have. Let's see everything that
2:14:19.679" end="02:14:24.000we have on the master branch. So this is
2:14:21.599" end="02:14:26.480pre-eployment. Then the deployment up
2:14:24.000" end="02:14:28.159until this point. So you can maybe also
2:14:26.480" end="02:14:30.000run into some of those errors that I
2:14:28.159" end="02:14:32.800had. And then this is going to be the
2:14:30.000" end="02:14:36.320final the final boss really of this of
2:14:32.800" end="02:14:38.320this project. Okay, let's get started.
2:14:36.320" end="02:14:39.119So, let's see. A couple of things that I
2:14:38.320" end="02:14:40.159want to do. I want to do some
2:14:39.119" end="02:14:42.480refactoring and I want to do a
2:14:40.159" end="02:14:44.239deployment with UV. Let's see. First, I
2:14:42.480" end="02:14:46.239want I want to I just want to make it
2:14:44.239" end="02:14:48.079super fast and go with UV and
2:14:46.239" end="02:14:49.440standardize all of this. But that can
2:14:48.079" end="02:14:51.440sometimes be a little bit tricky with
2:14:49.440" end="02:14:54.239Docker files, but I I know that it that
2:14:51.440" end="02:14:56.000it's possible. So,
2:14:54.239" end="02:14:57.679all right, the project is in a really
2:14:56.000" end="02:15:00.000good spot right now, but I want you to
2:14:57.679" end="02:15:03.360look at the deployment strategy, and I
2:15:00.000" end="02:15:08.159want you to look into the Docker file.
2:15:03.360" end="02:15:10.400And I want to first install UV on our
2:15:08.159" end="02:15:13.440server and then manage all of the
2:15:10.400" end="02:15:17.280dependencies from our pi project.toml
2:15:13.440" end="02:15:19.119instead of having a requirements.txt.
2:15:17.280" end="02:15:20.800Can you first focus on that? If you're
2:15:19.119" end="02:15:22.880not sure how to do that, please look it
2:15:20.800" end="02:15:25.199up because it is possible. You can do
2:15:22.880" end="02:15:27.679this. All right. After a little bit of
2:15:25.199" end="02:15:30.239tinkering, we got it. It's now
2:15:27.679" end="02:15:32.719processing the email. There we go. Email
2:15:30.239" end="02:15:34.560sent. I made some changes and I do want
2:15:32.719" end="02:15:37.760to check if we can still run it via UV
2:15:34.560" end="02:15:39.599but also this works. What I did is I
2:15:37.760" end="02:15:40.800pretty much took a look at our
2:15:39.599" end="02:15:42.480deployment script that we have in the
2:15:40.800" end="02:15:44.159Geni Launchpad to figure out look what
2:15:42.480" end="02:15:47.520is actually the pattern that we need to
2:15:44.159" end="02:15:49.920use here. Um and I do run a UV pip
2:15:47.520" end="02:15:51.920install on the pi project atoml right
2:15:49.920" end="02:15:53.920now. Like I've said the other the other
2:15:51.920" end="02:15:57.679way around should also theoretically
2:15:53.920" end="02:15:59.920work but just to keep it simple for now
2:15:57.679" end="02:16:02.960let's do this. And I just I just want to
2:15:59.920" end="02:16:05.679know like this should be able to
2:16:02.960" end="02:16:08.159this should also work. I just want to I
2:16:05.679" end="02:16:09.920just want to know. All right, there we
2:16:08.159" end="02:16:13.440go. So, we made a change. Now, we use
2:16:09.920" end="02:16:15.840it. We run it using UV. And here we go.
2:16:13.440" end="02:16:17.760It's here again. We got the email again.
2:16:15.840" end="02:16:19.520So, like I've said, this is one of those
2:16:17.760" end="02:16:21.119this is always the most tricky things
2:16:19.520" end="02:16:22.480about
2:16:21.119" end="02:16:23.760literally building your projects and
2:16:22.480" end="02:16:25.360deploying them because it's always
2:16:23.760" end="02:16:26.960really abstract to figure out look
2:16:25.360" end="02:16:28.560what's actually going on behind the
2:16:26.960" end="02:16:30.000scenes on the server. So this is all
2:16:28.560" end="02:16:31.840running on Linux. So it's a little bit
2:16:30.000" end="02:16:34.240different to your current operating
2:16:31.840" end="02:16:37.200system. But what we're pretty much doing
2:16:34.240" end="02:16:38.559right now is we're using UV to install
2:16:37.200" end="02:16:42.319all the requirements from the pi
2:16:38.559" end="02:16:45.439projectl. And we do it systemwide. And
2:16:42.319" end="02:16:47.040because we do that, we could pretty much
2:16:45.439" end="02:16:48.559run it from from everywhere. We could
2:16:47.040" end="02:16:50.160use it. We could run it. That's my
2:16:48.559" end="02:16:51.599assumption. We could run with Python. We
2:16:50.160" end="02:16:53.359could run it with UV. That doesn't
2:16:51.599" end="02:16:55.280really matter because now systemwide if
2:16:53.359" end="02:16:57.760we use Python these [clears throat]
2:16:55.280" end="02:16:59.519dependencies will be installed. So, we
2:16:57.760" end="02:17:01.120have our deployment final in here. This
2:16:59.519" end="02:17:03.200is looking good. This is now very
2:17:01.120" end="02:17:05.280efficient. It's optimized. We really
2:17:03.200" end="02:17:08.000only got what we need. We have the
2:17:05.280" end="02:17:10.479environment variables in here. Cool.
2:17:08.000" end="02:17:14.080Let's now come back over here and start
2:17:10.479" end="02:17:17.599to kind of like wrap up this project.
2:17:14.080" end="02:17:20.880And what I Let's see. There's a couple
2:17:17.599" end="02:17:23.599of things that I want to do. First of
2:17:20.880" end="02:17:28.559all, I want to make sure that there are
2:17:23.599" end="02:17:30.240no duplicate digests. So, imagine this,
2:17:28.559" end="02:17:31.439right? You have kind of like a 24-hour
2:17:30.240" end="02:17:33.920window. Maybe there's a little bit of
2:17:31.439" end="02:17:35.920overlap. You on the morning, you don't
2:17:33.920" end="02:17:38.639want an
2:17:35.920" end="02:17:41.679an email from a daily digest item that
2:17:38.639" end="02:17:44.399you already had. So, I'm now going to
2:17:41.679" end="02:17:47.200ask to say, &quot;No, this is going to be an
2:17:44.399" end="02:17:48.559agent.&quot; Okay, perfect. We're in a good
2:17:47.200" end="02:17:51.200spot right now. So the only thing that I
2:17:48.559" end="02:17:54.479want to do is I want to keep track of
2:17:51.200" end="02:17:59.599the digest items that we already shared
2:17:54.479" end="02:18:01.840with the user. So can you help me figure
2:17:59.599" end="02:18:03.679out a plan to structure this most
2:18:01.840" end="02:18:06.080effectively? So whenever we have to
2:18:03.679" end="02:18:08.960digest items then in the process email
2:18:06.080" end="02:18:12.800we rank them and see and we select which
2:18:08.960" end="02:18:15.120ones we want to send and then we want we
2:18:12.800" end="02:18:17.920somehow want to track that. Can you
2:18:15.120" end="02:18:19.840think about a way to do this? Okay. So,
2:18:17.920" end="02:18:23.280how that would probably work is we would
2:18:19.840" end="02:18:25.760go into our database. We would go into
2:18:23.280" end="02:18:28.000our models and we'll probably have
2:18:25.760" end="02:18:30.559something.
2:18:28.000" end="02:18:32.399Let's see what is it going to do. It's
2:18:30.559" end="02:18:34.800going to update the models. Send at.
2:18:32.399" end="02:18:37.599Yeah. So, we're going to we're going to
2:18:34.800" end="02:18:40.080do that. It's going to do the send at.
2:18:37.599" end="02:18:42.399Okay. So, it's adding that to to to
2:18:40.080" end="02:18:44.880this. We need a little database
2:18:42.399" end="02:18:46.880migration. Okay. Looking good. So in the
2:18:44.880" end="02:18:48.559process email we first just do a check,
2:18:46.880" end="02:18:52.479right? So we're going to check like if
2:18:48.559" end="02:18:55.359it's before sending the email we do a
2:18:52.479" end="02:18:56.960check. Yeah, we mark it as count and we
2:18:55.359" end="02:18:59.200have the repository that's just an
2:18:56.960" end="02:19:00.800extension of that to get the recent
2:18:59.200" end="02:19:03.599digest. There's an extension and now we
2:19:00.800" end="02:19:07.760have the migration. So now we just need
2:19:03.599" end="02:19:09.679to check whether let's see it's going to
2:19:07.760" end="02:19:12.559take the database connection but this is
2:19:09.679" end="02:19:14.319now the local this is now the local one.
2:19:12.559" end="02:19:16.479So
2:19:14.319" end="02:19:20.800I don't have it set up to work with the
2:19:16.479" end="02:19:23.439production database just yet. So that's
2:19:20.800" end="02:19:25.280let's see that's actually something that
2:19:23.439" end="02:19:28.399would be helpful to add to this as well
2:19:25.280" end="02:19:31.280because now I've only connected to it
2:19:28.399" end="02:19:33.920using table plus right but if we wanted
2:19:31.280" end="02:19:37.040to make some changes now going forward
2:19:33.920" end="02:19:39.519and want to keep that in sync it would
2:19:37.040" end="02:19:42.880make sense to also have the the
2:19:39.519" end="02:19:45.840production connection in there. So okay
2:19:42.880" end="02:19:47.599let's check. Awesome. Yeah that works.
2:19:45.840" end="02:19:49.600But now that performs the migration on
2:19:47.599" end="02:19:53.600the local database. Can you actually
2:19:49.600" end="02:19:55.760update the environment variables so that
2:19:53.600" end="02:19:58.000we can also
2:19:55.760" end="02:20:01.280can you extend it so that we have a
2:19:58.000" end="02:20:03.120difference between the local database
2:20:01.280" end="02:20:05.120and the production database? What would
2:20:03.120" end="02:20:07.520be a best practice to set that up so we
2:20:05.120" end="02:20:09.600can easily switch and also perform this
2:20:07.520" end="02:20:12.880migration on the real database? What do
2:20:09.600" end="02:20:15.359you need from me? So let's see how it is
2:20:12.880" end="02:20:17.200going to set this up because now if you
2:20:15.359" end="02:20:20.000remember right in our example we have
2:20:17.200" end="02:20:22.560the configuration for our lo our local
2:20:20.000" end="02:20:25.120database. So here you can see this is
2:20:22.560" end="02:20:28.080already automatically generated. So
2:20:25.120" end="02:20:30.479let's see what this looks like. Okay. So
2:20:28.080" end="02:20:34.080now we have a little readme file in
2:20:30.479" end="02:20:36.479here. So now we can check here for the
2:20:34.080" end="02:20:38.800configuration. So now we can set the
2:20:36.479" end="02:20:40.479environment. We can set it to local. We
2:20:38.800" end="02:20:43.280can set it produ to production. And then
2:20:40.479" end="02:20:46.479we need the database connection. What we
2:20:43.280" end="02:20:48.800need? It automatically detects it. Yeah.
2:20:46.479" end="02:20:51.280And then we need the database URL. Yes.
2:20:48.800" end="02:20:53.280We uses the URL provided by render. So
2:20:51.280" end="02:20:56.319that's the external one. So now what I'm
2:20:53.280" end="02:20:59.359going to do is look in we have the
2:20:56.319" end="02:21:01.760example env. We have that over here.
2:20:59.359" end="02:21:04.080Let's see. Let's actually how what does
2:21:01.760" end="02:21:06.240this look like? Yeah. Okay. This is all
2:21:04.080" end="02:21:08.800just comments. So we have it local. What
2:21:06.240" end="02:21:10.720I'm going to do right now, I'm going to
2:21:08.800" end="02:21:14.000switch to this and I'm going to into my
2:21:10.720" end="02:21:16.880actual ENV and
2:21:14.000" end="02:21:20.800I'm going to copy paste what you just
2:21:16.880" end="02:21:22.720saw in the example and I'm going to set
2:21:20.800" end="02:21:25.040the database to production. And what I'm
2:21:22.720" end="02:21:29.200now going to do is now let me actually
2:21:25.040" end="02:21:33.120show you. I'm coming back to render
2:21:29.200" end="02:21:34.640and I'm coming to my database. So in the
2:21:33.120" end="02:21:36.720blueprints,
2:21:34.640" end="02:21:39.120so this is the this is the tricky stuff,
2:21:36.720" end="02:21:41.200guys. This is the well really the big
2:21:39.120" end="02:21:43.439difference between running a local demo
2:21:41.200" end="02:21:44.880and a production app. You have to tinker
2:21:43.439" end="02:21:47.359with these kind of things. If I scroll
2:21:44.880" end="02:21:49.680all the way down, there's these external
2:21:47.359" end="02:21:51.920database URL. I'm going to copy this one
2:21:49.680" end="02:21:53.920and I'm going to plug that into my
2:21:51.920" end="02:21:57.280environment variables.
2:21:53.920" end="02:21:58.640So that would go under the database URL.
2:21:57.280" end="02:22:00.160So I'm going to plug that in. That
2:21:58.640" end="02:22:01.439contains everything. So this is also
2:22:00.160" end="02:22:03.920very sensitive. if you want to be
2:22:01.439" end="02:22:06.560careful with that. Right now, this is
2:22:03.920" end="02:22:09.280also this database is still accessible
2:22:06.560" end="02:22:10.960publicly. So later down the line, I'll
2:22:09.280" end="02:22:12.640probably show you how you how we can
2:22:10.960" end="02:22:14.880protect this. That would probably be the
2:22:12.640" end="02:22:19.439last step to to do this to whitelist
2:22:14.880" end="02:22:21.680your IP address. So let's see. Let's
2:22:19.439" end="02:22:23.600close this out.
2:22:21.680" end="02:22:26.720Okay, let's come back. So what I just
2:22:23.600" end="02:22:30.560did, look again, this is the example I
2:22:26.720" end="02:22:33.439in the ENV file over here. This one I
2:22:30.560" end="02:22:35.840change this to production and I put the
2:22:33.439" end="02:22:40.000URL that we just copied from render in
2:22:35.840" end="02:22:42.720here. So now what we can do
2:22:40.000" end="02:22:45.200look so now we have updated the get
2:22:42.720" end="02:22:48.560database info as well and then we can
2:22:45.200" end="02:22:50.399keep this keep all of this. So now what
2:22:48.560" end="02:22:52.160should happen if we come over here to
2:22:50.399" end="02:22:55.439the database this is the production
2:22:52.160" end="02:22:58.000version if we have the digest right now
2:22:55.439" end="02:23:00.960there's not a send at over here what I
2:22:58.000" end="02:23:03.439want to validate right now is whether if
2:23:00.960" end="02:23:05.680we let's see we have to check connection
2:23:03.439" end="02:23:07.920it would be a good yeah it would be a
2:23:05.680" end="02:23:10.000good best practice to do this first to
2:23:07.920" end="02:23:13.040check if if we have the database
2:23:10.000" end="02:23:16.000connection yeah production environment
2:23:13.040" end="02:23:17.760host connection successful
2:23:16.000" end="02:23:19.520perfect so it checked everything. So now
2:23:17.760" end="02:23:21.920we can see look we have a successful
2:23:19.520" end="02:23:25.760connection to our production database
2:23:21.920" end="02:23:28.640which is really good and then yeah let's
2:23:25.760" end="02:23:31.840close this out. So now I'm going to run
2:23:28.640" end="02:23:33.520this migrate at send one more time. So
2:23:31.840" end="02:23:36.240I'm going to run this and now this
2:23:33.520" end="02:23:38.240should perform the migration. And now
2:23:36.240" end="02:23:41.280later if you like really want to do this
2:23:38.240" end="02:23:43.680properly you would do this ideally with
2:23:41.280" end="02:23:45.439something like Alamic which is also
2:23:43.680" end="02:23:47.680something we use in our our production
2:23:45.439" end="02:23:50.080builds but for now so is a way to manage
2:23:47.680" end="02:23:51.600database migrations for now I'm just
2:23:50.080" end="02:23:54.240doing it like this because I'm just
2:23:51.600" end="02:23:56.560making small little changes over here
2:23:54.240" end="02:23:58.240just working towards the first version.
2:23:56.560" end="02:23:59.520Oh it's asking oh there's a built-in
2:23:58.240" end="02:24:01.359warning you're about to migrate
2:23:59.520" end="02:24:04.800production database type yes to
2:24:01.359" end="02:24:07.840continue. I love this. That's good.
2:24:04.800" end="02:24:10.160That's good. So yeah, let's do this.
2:24:07.840" end="02:24:13.359There we go. Okay, perfect. So now if we
2:24:10.160" end="02:24:15.040come over here and refresh this
2:24:13.359" end="02:24:18.560digest,
2:24:15.040" end="02:24:20.399send at this going really smooth. Okay,
2:24:18.560" end="02:24:23.760so now we can also just get get rid of
2:24:20.399" end="02:24:26.000this file. The thing is when you so if
2:24:23.760" end="02:24:27.760you're following along in this final
2:24:26.000" end="02:24:30.960this is the final build. So the thing is
2:24:27.760" end="02:24:33.600you'll already have the models in here
2:24:30.960" end="02:24:36.000with the send at. So whenever you
2:24:33.600" end="02:24:38.560redeploy this and start with a a
2:24:36.000" end="02:24:40.319database from scratch, it's going to
2:24:38.560" end="02:24:42.080automatically adjust this. It can what
2:24:40.319" end="02:24:44.399you can also do is just like you delete
2:24:42.080" end="02:24:45.920all the tables and trigger the chron job
2:24:44.399" end="02:24:49.840again because that's also going to
2:24:45.920" end="02:24:52.399create the tables. That all works. Okay,
2:24:49.840" end="02:24:54.080where are we? So this is going good.
2:24:52.399" end="02:24:57.040This is going good. So now we have to
2:24:54.080" end="02:24:59.439check connection in there. That's good.
2:24:57.040" end="02:25:03.040We have the connection is now either
2:24:59.439" end="02:25:06.160environment or local. So that's good.
2:25:03.040" end="02:25:08.319That's now very nice and neat in there.
2:25:06.160" end="02:25:12.479And then the only thing that we needed
2:25:08.319" end="02:25:15.280to check is yeah the send at. So if I
2:25:12.479" end="02:25:18.399now just go to the digests
2:25:15.280" end="02:25:21.120and let's just get rid of this. Let's
2:25:18.399" end="02:25:22.720let's not do that. So let's see. Let's
2:25:21.120" end="02:25:25.760refresh.
2:25:22.720" end="02:25:29.600There we go. It's empty again.
2:25:25.760" end="02:25:31.920Now let's trigger the job one more time.
2:25:29.600" end="02:25:36.080So go to blueprints to our news
2:25:31.920" end="02:25:39.040aggregator to our chron job trigger run.
2:25:36.080" end="02:25:42.240So now we wait for this to run
2:25:39.040" end="02:25:45.040everything. Okay, successful. There we
2:25:42.240" end="02:25:48.319are again. Let's come back. So now we
2:25:45.040" end="02:25:53.280should have let's see. There we go. So
2:25:48.319" end="02:25:56.560we have two in here. And then
2:25:53.280" end="02:26:00.000send ads. Is this correctly updated?
2:25:56.560" end="02:26:02.560doesn't look like it is. And that is
2:26:00.000" end="02:26:05.840maybe because
2:26:02.560" end="02:26:08.960we still have to
2:26:05.840" end="02:26:10.479ah of course we we haven't pushed the we
2:26:08.960" end="02:26:13.439haven't pushed these we haven't push
2:26:10.479" end="02:26:14.880these changes yet. Okay. So this is
2:26:13.439" end="02:26:17.280something that would we we would then
2:26:14.880" end="02:26:20.000ideally first test locally to see if
2:26:17.280" end="02:26:22.240that works. So that is something that I
2:26:20.000" end="02:26:24.560can do right now. So then what I would
2:26:22.240" end="02:26:27.040do is I would go into the app and then
2:26:24.560" end="02:26:30.240go to the environment, set it back to
2:26:27.040" end="02:26:32.319local. And this is this is really the
2:26:30.240" end="02:26:34.319final straw of the video, guys. But this
2:26:32.319" end="02:26:35.920is also probably the one where you'll
2:26:34.319" end="02:26:38.240learn the most because it's in the
2:26:35.920" end="02:26:39.680beginning it's so challenging to manage
2:26:38.240" end="02:26:41.439different environments, right? Because
2:26:39.680" end="02:26:43.439it's so abstract because even I right
2:26:41.439" end="02:26:45.120now it's like let's test this. Why is it
2:26:43.439" end="02:26:47.520not working? That's because I'm working
2:26:45.120" end="02:26:50.000locally. And you constantly need to keep
2:26:47.520" end="02:26:51.680an eye on that what's local, what's in
2:26:50.000" end="02:26:53.280production. And that is if if you only
2:26:51.680" end="02:26:56.160have local and production. If you have
2:26:53.280" end="02:26:58.880no a whole like acceptation maybe
2:26:56.160" end="02:27:00.720testing acceptation production then it
2:26:58.880" end="02:27:02.319gets even more complicated with all of
2:27:00.720" end="02:27:05.600the different environment variables that
2:27:02.319" end="02:27:07.840you that you have to check because
2:27:05.600" end="02:27:12.080what we can do right now look if we now
2:27:07.840" end="02:27:14.640just come in here and we're going to
2:27:12.080" end="02:27:16.800pretty much just open up a new terminal.
2:27:14.640" end="02:27:18.560Now it's set to local. So I'm going to
2:27:16.800" end="02:27:22.240do UV.
2:27:18.560" end="02:27:23.840Let's see. Because if I now switch to
2:27:22.240" end="02:27:28.160So, we're going to switch to the a to
2:27:23.840" end="02:27:30.800the local one and get the digests. Just
2:27:28.160" end="02:27:33.680get that empty. Now, we're going to run
2:27:30.800" end="02:27:37.280it locally one more time. So, y u run
2:27:33.680" end="02:27:39.280main and the So, this is going to run.
2:27:37.280" end="02:27:40.880This is going to scrape. Let's see. The
2:27:39.280" end="02:27:43.439send ad was already here because I
2:27:40.880" end="02:27:45.920performed the local migration.
2:27:43.439" end="02:27:48.479Let's see. It's going to rank. That
2:27:45.920" end="02:27:50.399looks good. Do we have another email?
2:27:48.479" end="02:27:52.080There we go. We have another email. So,
2:27:50.399" end="02:27:56.080that looks good. Now, if I come in the
2:27:52.080" end="02:27:58.240local database, let's come in here. Do
2:27:56.080" end="02:28:00.560we have the digests?
2:27:58.240" end="02:28:02.000So, now I I think here's there's
2:28:00.560" end="02:28:03.760something tricky going on because I
2:28:02.000" end="02:28:05.680changed it to local, but look, it's it
2:28:03.760" end="02:28:08.160still says if I do the check connection,
2:28:05.680" end="02:28:10.560it still says that it's in the
2:28:08.160" end="02:28:12.560production environment and I just
2:28:10.560" end="02:28:14.479checked. If I go to the production
2:28:12.560" end="02:28:17.200database, you can see right now we have
2:28:14.479" end="02:28:19.120to send at. So the logic is working that
2:28:17.200" end="02:28:22.640is good. But now we need to figure out
2:28:19.120" end="02:28:24.720look why is it not in the
2:28:22.640" end="02:28:27.520why is it not in the local database. So
2:28:24.720" end="02:28:30.720why is this where is it getting? So we
2:28:27.520" end="02:28:35.920do get database info. Let's see what's
2:28:30.720" end="02:28:37.439in here. We get why is this not working?
2:28:35.920" end="02:28:39.520Okay. Okay. And I now actually see that
2:28:37.439" end="02:28:41.359if the database URL is set and it
2:28:39.520" end="02:28:43.920contains something like render, it
2:28:41.359" end="02:28:45.200automatically checks or it automatically
2:28:43.920" end="02:28:47.920assumes that this is the production
2:28:45.200" end="02:28:50.160environment. So what I now want to do is
2:28:47.920" end="02:28:53.359I want to go and pretty much comment out
2:28:50.160" end="02:28:55.920the database URL. So we don't need that.
2:28:53.359" end="02:28:59.920And then let's see if I come to check
2:28:55.920" end="02:29:02.000connection one more time. Now run this.
2:28:59.920" end="02:29:03.600Now we're local. Okay, that's good. Now
2:29:02.000" end="02:29:06.319we're local. So now I can just open up
2:29:03.600" end="02:29:09.359the terminal once more.
2:29:06.319" end="02:29:12.000run this and then we should validate
2:29:09.359" end="02:29:15.040this in the local version of our
2:29:12.000" end="02:29:18.160database. So let's give this a couple of
2:29:15.040" end="02:29:20.880seconds. We have one more email. That's
2:29:18.160" end="02:29:23.120good. That all works. Now coming to the
2:29:20.880" end="02:29:25.120local. Let's see. This is the local
2:29:23.120" end="02:29:28.319database. Refresh this. We should see
2:29:25.120" end="02:29:30.319the digest in here. We have the YouTube
2:29:28.319" end="02:29:33.680videos. That's good. We have the title
2:29:30.319" end="02:29:35.280summary. Yeah. So these are sent.
2:29:33.680" end="02:29:37.600Awesome. So that's good. We have the
2:29:35.280" end="02:29:41.920YouTube videos. Everything's still here.
2:29:37.600" end="02:29:44.720Transcript is in here. That looks That
2:29:41.920" end="02:29:48.000looks good. Okay. So, this now this
2:29:44.720" end="02:29:49.920logic now seems to work. So, that's just
2:29:48.000" end="02:29:51.680another way to make this a little bit
2:29:49.920" end="02:29:53.359more
2:29:51.680" end="02:29:55.200reliable.
2:29:53.359" end="02:29:57.439And we're almost we're almost there.
2:29:55.200" end="02:29:59.760We're almost there. So, now pretty much
2:29:57.439" end="02:30:03.840what I want to do, this all looks good.
2:29:59.760" end="02:30:06.080We can now switch. The thing is,
2:30:03.840" end="02:30:08.080yeah, the nice thing is because it's set
2:30:06.080" end="02:30:09.120up like this
2:30:08.080" end="02:30:11.040within, [clears throat] let's see,
2:30:09.120" end="02:30:12.880within the readme,
2:30:11.040" end="02:30:14.240I pretty much don't have to, that's
2:30:12.880" end="02:30:18.000probably why it did this. I don't have
2:30:14.240" end="02:30:20.080to change anything on my
2:30:18.000" end="02:30:22.160server with the environment variables
2:30:20.080" end="02:30:24.399because now it like we saw, we don't
2:30:22.160" end="02:30:28.000need to update the [clears throat]
2:30:24.399" end="02:30:31.439environment because if we let's see on
2:30:28.000" end="02:30:34.479the settings. So this is is it on? Yeah,
2:30:31.439" end="02:30:35.760it's I think it's over here. We should
2:30:34.479" end="02:30:38.560somewhere where are the environment
2:30:35.760" end="02:30:40.160variables? Let's see. Environment manage
2:30:38.560" end="02:30:41.520environment. Look, here are all the
2:30:40.160" end="02:30:43.520environment variables that we set.
2:30:41.520" end="02:30:44.880Remember, we don't have to put in the
2:30:43.520" end="02:30:48.560environment here right now because
2:30:44.880" end="02:30:51.120databases URL is already set by render.
2:30:48.560" end="02:30:52.640And I'm assuming it just capture that
2:30:51.120" end="02:30:54.560captures that automatically on the
2:30:52.640" end="02:30:57.280server. But we'll have to do a final
2:30:54.560" end="02:30:59.680check for that. Okay, wrapping things
2:30:57.280" end="02:31:02.720up. So that's all good. Let's first
2:30:59.680" end="02:31:04.319commit this. I'm not going to push this
2:31:02.720" end="02:31:07.600just yet because that would trigger a
2:31:04.319" end="02:31:10.399redeployment. What I am also going to do
2:31:07.600" end="02:31:12.720is I'm going to let's say I'm going to
2:31:10.399" end="02:31:14.319create a new folder
2:31:12.720" end="02:31:16.399call it docs where we have the
2:31:14.319" end="02:31:19.600deployment.
2:31:16.399" end="02:31:23.520And let's see the render setup. I'm
2:31:19.600" end="02:31:25.760going to put everything there. And now
2:31:23.520" end="02:31:28.080let's see. We should definitely update
2:31:25.760" end="02:31:30.880the readme file in here to understand
2:31:28.080" end="02:31:33.120what's going on. And we also have the we
2:31:30.880" end="02:31:36.080have this one in the database. I think
2:31:33.120" end="02:31:39.040that that makes sense to leave here for
2:31:36.080" end="02:31:41.760now. But I'm pretty much I I think I'm
2:31:39.040" end="02:31:44.560just going to do the final final check
2:31:41.760" end="02:31:46.160for this to like really wrap up the
2:31:44.560" end="02:31:48.960project and maybe do a little bit of
2:31:46.160" end="02:31:51.680refactoring, see if everything works.
2:31:48.960" end="02:31:54.240And then that should be it. Then from
2:31:51.680" end="02:31:56.080there it can pretty much run and the
2:31:54.240" end="02:31:57.680rest is really like up to you like do
2:31:56.080" end="02:32:00.240you want to add different sources? Do
2:31:57.680" end="02:32:02.080you want to change the HTML format of
2:32:00.240" end="02:32:04.399the email do you set that you send? Do
2:32:02.080" end="02:32:06.800you want to change the prompts? But then
2:32:04.399" end="02:32:08.560the playground is there. So I'm going
2:32:06.800" end="02:32:11.760into plan mode and we're going to do
2:32:08.560" end="02:32:13.680something like this. All right, we now
2:32:11.760" end="02:32:16.560have the project at a pretty good spot.
2:32:13.680" end="02:32:17.920I want to do a final wrap up. Here are
2:32:16.560" end="02:32:20.720some things that I want you to look at.
2:32:17.920" end="02:32:24.399So, first of all, let's go through the
2:32:20.720" end="02:32:26.800app folder and see if we can potentially
2:32:24.399" end="02:32:30.640optimize and refactor the code to
2:32:26.800" end="02:32:32.800overall make it easier, less redundant.
2:32:30.640" end="02:32:34.880Is there a way to do this without
2:32:32.800" end="02:32:36.319changing the database models? I don't
2:32:34.880" end="02:32:38.479want to touch that. That's in a good
2:32:36.319" end="02:32:41.760spot right now. But maybe you can look
2:32:38.479" end="02:32:44.479into creating some some base classes and
2:32:41.760" end="02:32:46.640potentially using some inheritance to
2:32:44.479" end="02:32:48.720simplify some of the scrapers in there.
2:32:46.640" end="02:32:50.720Maybe that's possible if it makes sense.
2:32:48.720" end="02:32:52.319But you tell me. Don't just follow my
2:32:50.720" end="02:32:54.720words in there. I want you to do a
2:32:52.319" end="02:32:57.120critical review. I pretty much want to
2:32:54.720" end="02:33:00.160optimize for a codebase that's very lean
2:32:57.120" end="02:33:02.560and maintainable and also modular enough
2:33:00.160" end="02:33:05.280that we can easily add more scrapers
2:33:02.560" end="02:33:07.840down the line without adding much extra
2:33:05.280" end="02:33:10.319complexity and overhead. So go through
2:33:07.840" end="02:33:13.840the entire project pretty much figure
2:33:10.319" end="02:33:15.520out some tweaks that we can make and
2:33:13.840" end="02:33:18.560then once you've done that and made
2:33:15.520" end="02:33:22.000those changes I want you to update the
2:33:18.560" end="02:33:25.040final read me of this in the root of
2:33:22.000" end="02:33:27.439this project in order to highle describe
2:33:25.040" end="02:33:30.319what this project is about and how it
2:33:27.439" end="02:33:33.280works. So that's that's an instruction
2:33:30.319" end="02:33:36.080there to to the eye. And notice there
2:33:33.280" end="02:33:40.000were really a couple of things there. So
2:33:36.080" end="02:33:41.680AI really likes to like just go with you
2:33:40.000" end="02:33:43.359and say, &quot;Look, you're totally right. We
2:33:41.680" end="02:33:44.640completely need to refactor this and all
2:33:43.359" end="02:33:47.760of that and we can do this and this and
2:33:44.640" end="02:33:49.680that.&quot; But you always kind of like want
2:33:47.760" end="02:33:53.040to be careful with that and challenge
2:33:49.680" end="02:33:57.120it. So what I just said like maybe like
2:33:53.040" end="02:33:59.760introducing new classes and doing some
2:33:57.120" end="02:34:01.600base classes and then class inheritance.
2:33:59.760" end="02:34:02.800I think that makes sense here because we
2:34:01.600" end="02:34:04.800have different we have multiple
2:34:02.800" end="02:34:06.880scrapers. So look, it can also see with
2:34:04.800" end="02:34:09.920scraper uh duplication. So the entropic
2:34:06.880" end="02:34:12.880scraper and the openi scraper share 80%
2:34:09.920" end="02:34:14.720identical RSS parsing logic. That's I
2:34:12.880" end="02:34:17.439when we were creating this I already saw
2:34:14.720" end="02:34:20.160that. So that's something we can do. We
2:34:17.439" end="02:34:22.560have cy.path we can streamline that
2:34:20.160" end="02:34:24.960repository pattern duplication similar
2:34:22.560" end="02:34:26.399build create methods I think. Yeah that
2:34:24.960" end="02:34:29.120the definitely if we go into the
2:34:26.399" end="02:34:32.960database this was also getting really
2:34:29.120" end="02:34:35.280big the repository pattern. So for every
2:34:32.960" end="02:34:38.479operation, it added a new function to
2:34:35.280" end="02:34:40.319that. So that also sounds like a plan.
2:34:38.479" end="02:34:42.160Then we have the refactoring strategy.
2:34:40.319" end="02:34:44.960Yeah, a base scraper. That's good.
2:34:42.160" end="02:34:47.120Generic article. Get articles. Yeah,
2:34:44.960" end="02:34:49.439this is going to be exciting. Looks
2:34:47.120" end="02:34:51.439good. Simplified repository pattern.
2:34:49.439" end="02:34:55.439Remove that.
2:34:51.439" end="02:34:57.439Create scraper registry pattern.
2:34:55.439" end="02:35:01.120This I think is actually going to be
2:34:57.439" end="02:35:03.840this is going to be fire. Yeah. Yeah.
2:35:01.120" end="02:35:06.640This is going to be fire.
2:35:03.840" end="02:35:10.560Are we checked in? Let's see. Let's do
2:35:06.640" end="02:35:13.680one final commit so we are sure. What do
2:35:10.560" end="02:35:17.560what did we update here? Yes. Yeah.
2:35:13.680" end="02:35:17.560Let's go build this stuff.
2:35:17.600" end="02:35:22.160And with this is this is a really big
2:35:20.160" end="02:35:23.600big task going to do here and you really
2:35:22.160" end="02:35:25.680want to thoroughly check this. And this
2:35:23.600" end="02:35:27.840is also where you want to be careful as
2:35:25.680" end="02:35:30.720to really what it's doing because you
2:35:27.840" end="02:35:32.560should also make sure that you still
2:35:30.720" end="02:35:34.960understand your codebase, right? Because
2:35:32.560" end="02:35:37.760now it's structured relatively
2:35:34.960" end="02:35:40.560straightforward. But what we're going to
2:35:37.760" end="02:35:43.120do right now, let me show you like this
2:35:40.560" end="02:35:45.680is really where you get into like next
2:35:43.120" end="02:35:47.840level object object oriented programming
2:35:45.680" end="02:35:49.520where now look we in the scrapers we
2:35:47.840" end="02:35:52.240have a base class. We're going to create
2:35:49.520" end="02:35:54.399a base scraper where we're going to say
2:35:52.240" end="02:35:56.640look we have an article and we have a
2:35:54.399" end="02:35:59.359scraper and this is where we apply all
2:35:56.640" end="02:36:01.760of the parsing logic. Now then when we
2:35:59.359" end="02:36:03.760go into the entropic scraper you can see
2:36:01.760" end="02:36:06.880that right now we can get rid of a whole
2:36:03.760" end="02:36:09.840lot of code and we simply
2:36:06.880" end="02:36:11.680we don't even need this. We simply
2:36:09.840" end="02:36:13.439perform class inheritance where we can
2:36:11.680" end="02:36:15.280say look we have an entropic article
2:36:13.439" end="02:36:16.880which we inherit from an article and
2:36:15.280" end="02:36:18.960then we have the scraper which we
2:36:16.880" end="02:36:20.960inherit from the base scraper and now
2:36:18.960" end="02:36:22.479the entropic scraper pretty much has all
2:36:20.960" end="02:36:25.040of the functionality from the base
2:36:22.479" end="02:36:29.200scraper and we can just add to it what
2:36:25.040" end="02:36:32.000we need just that and this way we can
2:36:29.200" end="02:36:33.840really reduce the footprint of our
2:36:32.000" end="02:36:35.680project. Let's see it's still going. It
2:36:33.840" end="02:36:37.439is still going.
2:36:35.680" end="02:36:39.520So let's see what it did. So yeah, it's
2:36:37.439" end="02:36:42.640really it's touching a lot of files over
2:36:39.520" end="02:36:45.920here. So this is a big one. So we have a
2:36:42.640" end="02:36:47.920runner over here. Going to change that.
2:36:45.920" end="02:36:51.040And normally you would you would have to
2:36:47.920" end="02:36:53.680be really meticulous with with a change
2:36:51.040" end="02:36:55.439like this. But for now, for the sake of
2:36:53.680" end="02:36:58.479also just like moving a little bit
2:36:55.439" end="02:37:00.240faster. I'm just going to like put it to
2:36:58.479" end="02:37:02.319the test and actually see look if we
2:37:00.240" end="02:37:04.640were to deploy this. Can we still
2:37:02.319" end="02:37:07.520trigger Can we still trigger the chron
2:37:04.640" end="02:37:10.640job and does it still run? So now the
2:37:07.520" end="02:37:12.560okay so it's it's finalizing everything
2:37:10.640" end="02:37:15.200got the readme file. So this is now
2:37:12.560" end="02:37:17.120let's see okay it's creating all of this
2:37:15.200" end="02:37:20.479explaining everything that there is to
2:37:17.120" end="02:37:21.934it and also just like from
2:37:20.479" end="02:37:22.640what the [laughter]
2:37:21.934" end="02:37:26.160[gasps]
2:37:22.640" end="02:37:27.920we even have let's see I I want to make
2:37:26.160" end="02:37:29.120some I want to make some changes I I
2:37:27.920" end="02:37:32.080don't like this we can definitely do
2:37:29.120" end="02:37:34.720better there with a mermaid diagram but
2:37:32.080" end="02:37:38.160it's let's see this but this is a lot so
2:37:34.720" end="02:37:41.120we base class scrapers refactored agent
2:37:38.160" end="02:37:43.359refactored so we now have a base agent
2:37:41.120" end="02:37:45.760as Well, so in here we have also have a
2:37:43.359" end="02:37:48.800base agent and then from there we have
2:37:45.760" end="02:37:52.160the curator agent, the digest agent and
2:37:48.800" end="02:37:54.560the email agent. Beautiful results.
2:37:52.160" end="02:37:56.720Yeah, perfect. Can you do one final
2:37:54.560" end="02:37:59.040thing and in the readme file change the
2:37:56.720" end="02:38:00.720diagram to a mermaid diagram to explain
2:37:59.040" end="02:38:04.080the architecture?
2:38:00.720" end="02:38:06.160This is a lot. So it pretty much touched
2:38:04.080" end="02:38:09.920every file.
2:38:06.160" end="02:38:11.840Let's see. But you can also see yeah
2:38:09.920" end="02:38:14.319like this. Like I said, this is way too
2:38:11.840" end="02:38:15.920much to go through everything. So, we're
2:38:14.319" end="02:38:18.160just going to we're just going to test
2:38:15.920" end="02:38:20.399this and I'll leave it I'll leave it to
2:38:18.160" end="02:38:22.160you to like if you want to dive deeper
2:38:20.399" end="02:38:23.920into how all of this works and how it is
2:38:22.160" end="02:38:25.600now structured,
2:38:23.920" end="02:38:28.240you can dive into things. But this is
2:38:25.600" end="02:38:30.080really how I on a like serious client
2:38:28.240" end="02:38:33.040project for example would structure
2:38:30.080" end="02:38:35.359things. This is really the OOP way to do
2:38:33.040" end="02:38:38.560it. The object-oriented programming way
2:38:35.359" end="02:38:41.200to set up a proper Python project. Okay.
2:38:38.560" end="02:38:44.080So, now we have a mermaid diagram. Okay,
2:38:41.200" end="02:38:48.399let's let's just keep everything. Keep
2:38:44.080" end="02:38:51.359all 20 files. Bam. One shot. Let's close
2:38:48.399" end="02:38:53.200the chat over here. And now what I'm
2:38:51.359" end="02:38:56.880going to do,
2:38:53.200" end="02:39:00.160I just going to say big refactor.
2:38:56.880" end="02:39:03.120This is the big refactor. Let's
2:39:00.160" end="02:39:05.040commit, push, trigger the deployment.
2:39:03.120" end="02:39:08.960See if everything still works.
2:39:05.040" end="02:39:11.359Meanwhile, what we can do is we still
2:39:08.960" end="02:39:13.439have it on local. I'm just going to get
2:39:11.359" end="02:39:17.280rid of everything. Is this local? This
2:39:13.439" end="02:39:21.280is local. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Database
2:39:17.280" end="02:39:24.720completely empty. Coming back over here.
2:39:21.280" end="02:39:27.920UV run main.py.
2:39:24.720" end="02:39:29.600Creating the tables. Processing.
2:39:27.920" end="02:39:32.080It already looks like it's working
2:39:29.600" end="02:39:34.399flawlessly. Then this is where AI is so
2:39:32.080" end="02:39:36.160good because since you already have a
2:39:34.399" end="02:39:37.840proven pattern and a proven structure
2:39:36.160" end="02:39:41.359and you don't have to figure out the
2:39:37.840" end="02:39:43.920exact logic for refactoring, it is so
2:39:41.359" end="02:39:45.200insanely good. Like I was pretty
2:39:43.920" end="02:39:48.319confident that this would just work
2:39:45.200" end="02:39:50.160straight out of the box and it did. We
2:39:48.319" end="02:39:52.560have the let's see we have this again
2:39:50.160" end="02:39:54.880digest opening articles YouTube videos
2:39:52.560" end="02:39:58.560and there we have it. So now let's also
2:39:54.880" end="02:40:00.640go back to our builds
2:39:58.560" end="02:40:05.920to see
2:40:00.640" end="02:40:08.160over here on our builds the big refactor
2:40:05.920" end="02:40:11.200this is now triggering. I don't think we
2:40:08.160" end="02:40:14.080I we didn't make any changes to the to
2:40:11.200" end="02:40:15.520deployment itself. So I don't see any
2:40:14.080" end="02:40:17.439issues in here because it was pretty
2:40:15.520" end="02:40:20.560much everything was just in the app.py
2:40:17.439" end="02:40:22.720file. Now let's actually have a look at
2:40:20.560" end="02:40:24.960this branch
2:40:22.720" end="02:40:27.920and have a look at the readme file. So
2:40:24.960" end="02:40:30.000the AI news aggregator explains what it
2:40:27.920" end="02:40:31.840does. An overview
2:40:30.000" end="02:40:33.439with YouTube channel RSS feed process
2:40:31.840" end="02:40:36.720creation delivery. Beautiful
2:40:33.439" end="02:40:39.920architecture. We got source uh sources
2:40:36.720" end="02:40:41.680YouTube channels YouTube scraper
2:40:39.920" end="02:40:43.520database.
2:40:41.680" end="02:40:45.920I don't really like this diagram. We I
2:40:43.520" end="02:40:47.840think we can do better there. Can
2:40:45.920" end="02:40:51.280definitely do better there. Okay. How it
2:40:47.840" end="02:40:53.680works. We have the runner.py runs all
2:40:51.280" end="02:40:55.520register scrapers. Yeah. So that's what
2:40:53.680" end="02:40:58.800it now did. So that that is a really
2:40:55.520" end="02:41:01.840cool that's a really cool pattern. So
2:40:58.800" end="02:41:05.040let's see. It's an app.runner. So look
2:41:01.840" end="02:41:07.920now what you what you'll find in here.
2:41:05.040" end="02:41:10.880Save YouTube videos. Just yeah there is
2:41:07.920" end="02:41:13.359a scraping registry. So here you can see
2:41:10.880" end="02:41:16.240in the runner right now this is where we
2:41:13.359" end="02:41:18.080can register all of our scrapers
2:41:16.240" end="02:41:21.920even with the parameters in there. So
2:41:18.080" end="02:41:23.600this is now a really clean interface to
2:41:21.920" end="02:41:26.080register pretty much everything that we
2:41:23.600" end="02:41:28.399have and whenever we now in this folder
2:41:26.080" end="02:41:30.560we create a new scraper inherited from
2:41:28.399" end="02:41:33.120the base scraper. We can register it
2:41:30.560" end="02:41:35.520here and then the we can register it in
2:41:33.120" end="02:41:37.520the runner. So we have our processing
2:41:35.520" end="02:41:39.439layers, our curator, our email
2:41:37.520" end="02:41:40.960generator, the delivery, then the daily
2:41:39.439" end="02:41:43.120pipeline and we have the project
2:41:40.960" end="02:41:45.840structure all clearly document. So
2:41:43.120" end="02:41:47.760adding new scrapers. So this is now a
2:41:45.840" end="02:41:49.280super cool documentation to see. Look
2:41:47.760" end="02:41:51.280what we can do is we can add a new
2:41:49.280" end="02:41:53.280scraper in this folder. Here is what
2:41:51.280" end="02:41:57.600that would look like. We can add any XML
2:41:53.280" end="02:42:00.720feed to it or RSS feed I should say.
2:41:57.600" end="02:42:02.800Then we can register it in the runner.
2:42:00.720" end="02:42:06.560We can do even like a custom scraper.
2:42:02.800" end="02:42:08.640This is the setup installation.
2:42:06.560" end="02:42:10.479Set everything in here. Initialize
2:42:08.640" end="02:42:13.920database.
2:42:10.479" end="02:42:16.319Yes. Then you have the run setups
2:42:13.920" end="02:42:18.960running the full pipeline.
2:42:16.319" end="02:42:22.560And remember how earlier on this video I
2:42:18.960" end="02:42:25.680said where look, YouTube can temporarily
2:42:22.560" end="02:42:26.880block your IP from the internal API if
2:42:25.680" end="02:42:28.080you're trying to scrape too much
2:42:26.880" end="02:42:30.479transcript. So you can see the
2:42:28.080" end="02:42:32.560transcript is now not available. So this
2:42:30.479" end="02:42:36.319will now not be considered in the
2:42:32.560" end="02:42:39.600automation. But remember right we had if
2:42:36.319" end="02:42:42.319we come back over here to our app let's
2:42:39.600" end="02:42:44.880see are we good example yeah we should
2:42:42.319" end="02:42:48.880actually I should add that in there. So
2:42:44.880" end="02:42:50.560that's the web that's the web share
2:42:48.880" end="02:42:54.479proxy
2:42:50.560" end="02:42:58.160and I think this was where is this
2:42:54.479" end="02:43:01.760document? Is this documented somewhere?
2:42:58.160" end="02:43:04.720It's at least documented in the
2:43:01.760" end="02:43:08.160scraper in the YouTube surface. Yeah,
2:43:04.720" end="02:43:11.840look here we have the proxy username and
2:43:08.160" end="02:43:15.439the proxy password. So
2:43:11.840" end="02:43:17.680I am going to actually update that
2:43:15.439" end="02:43:21.040in the example. So we have web share
2:43:17.680" end="02:43:23.520username or sorry us proxy username and
2:43:21.040" end="02:43:25.040we have proxy
2:43:23.520" end="02:43:26.319password
2:43:25.040" end="02:43:29.120which we [clears throat] are going to
2:43:26.319" end="02:43:31.760set. And now again I'm going to switch
2:43:29.120" end="02:43:35.120over here and I'm going to simply copy
2:43:31.760" end="02:43:38.000paste this within my
2:43:35.120" end="02:43:41.040first of all in my env file. But we also
2:43:38.000" end="02:43:43.520need to update this on the server. So
2:43:41.040" end="02:43:46.080let me actually see I know where I have
2:43:43.520" end="02:43:48.800the what I'm doing right now is I'm
2:43:46.080" end="02:43:50.800opening up another project where I know
2:43:48.800" end="02:43:54.240I have those environment variables
2:43:50.800" end="02:43:58.240stored. So I'm just going in there and
2:43:54.240" end="02:44:00.880yeah, let's see. And there we have it.
2:43:58.240" end="02:44:02.720Actually going to plug that in. And what
2:44:00.880" end="02:44:04.720I'm actually going [clears throat] to do
2:44:02.720" end="02:44:07.040is I'm I'm going to say, look, this is
2:44:04.720" end="02:44:08.560web share because that that will make it
2:44:07.040" end="02:44:11.359easier
2:44:08.560" end="02:44:14.240also for you to recognize, right? So
2:44:11.359" end="02:44:16.319this is just going to be web share. And
2:44:14.240" end="02:44:18.080then we also need to update that in
2:44:16.319" end="02:44:20.720here. So we call that web share
2:44:18.080" end="02:44:23.120username, web share password. So this
2:44:20.720" end="02:44:27.200should already work. And so now it's
2:44:23.120" end="02:44:30.880updated in my local environment. You
2:44:27.200" end="02:44:33.040have it in here. Now also going to say,
2:44:30.880" end="02:44:36.800please add some instructions to the
2:44:33.040" end="02:44:39.840readme file on how to set up web share
2:44:36.800" end="02:44:44.640username and web share password. Stop
2:44:39.840" end="02:44:51.120this. I'm going to do YouTube transcript
2:44:44.640" end="02:44:53.279API pip because I know on the GitHub
2:44:51.120" end="02:44:56.479that's where it is explained how to do
2:44:53.279" end="02:45:00.240that and I f I followed that by example.
2:44:56.479" end="02:45:02.800Yeah, here we go. Then it says pretty
2:45:00.240" end="02:45:07.120much here what you need to here you need
2:45:02.800" end="02:45:08.800to get a residential one. So it is
2:45:07.120" end="02:45:10.479explained.
2:45:08.800" end="02:45:12.640Okay. So we're going to add that. Now
2:45:10.479" end="02:45:15.600also what I need to do so now it would
2:45:12.640" end="02:45:19.359work locally but now this would not work
2:45:15.600" end="02:45:20.720in our environment or our deployment I
2:45:19.359" end="02:45:23.439should say because then if we go to
2:45:20.720" end="02:45:26.160environment what I need to do is I need
2:45:23.439" end="02:45:28.800to let's see environment variables. I
2:45:26.160" end="02:45:30.800need to edit this. I need to add a new
2:45:28.800" end="02:45:33.840variable. I need to plug that in here.
2:45:30.800" end="02:45:39.520And now going to change this one more
2:45:33.840" end="02:45:42.800time to see look what is my username. So
2:45:39.520" end="02:45:44.800I have my username in here. So and I'm
2:45:42.800" end="02:45:48.640going to add new variable and then I'm
2:45:44.800" end="02:45:52.240going to do my password and plug that in
2:45:48.640" end="02:45:54.640there as well. And then save rebuild and
2:45:52.240" end="02:45:58.000apply on next run.
2:45:54.640" end="02:46:00.319Yeah. Okay. We're going to save that.
2:45:58.000" end="02:46:01.760Okay. Coming back. So now you can see
2:46:00.319" end="02:46:03.920look now I have the web share password
2:46:01.760" end="02:46:06.399and username also in here. We're going
2:46:03.920" end="02:46:09.200to trigger a redeployment.
2:46:06.399" end="02:46:11.680Look now it also explained the process
2:46:09.200" end="02:46:15.200of adding your username and password in
2:46:11.680" end="02:46:19.439there. Let's see we changed this. We
2:46:15.200" end="02:46:21.920updated the examples. So that is all
2:46:19.439" end="02:46:24.160good. So now I'm going to also trigger
2:46:21.920" end="02:46:25.920this from here to actually push this to
2:46:24.160" end="02:46:29.040push this code.
2:46:25.920" end="02:46:31.760And what this is pretty much doing is if
2:46:29.040" end="02:46:34.240you go in here,
2:46:31.760" end="02:46:38.960if you go to web share and like I said,
2:46:34.240" end="02:46:41.520you need to get a rotating residential
2:46:38.960" end="02:46:44.240pretty much what what it is going to do.
2:46:41.520" end="02:46:46.640And you should not like right now we're
2:46:44.240" end="02:46:48.880still like using the YouTube transcript
2:46:46.640" end="02:46:50.240API through like what I would say fair
2:46:48.880" end="02:46:51.840use because we could also do this
2:46:50.240" end="02:46:54.319manually and we're not scraping like
2:46:51.840" end="02:46:56.560massive amounts of data in here. But
2:46:54.319" end="02:46:59.040YouTube is having a limit on how much
2:46:56.560" end="02:47:02.240you can use that internal API. If you
2:46:59.040" end="02:47:04.479use a rotating residential proxy, pretty
2:47:02.240" end="02:47:06.240much every time you try and hit the
2:47:04.479" end="02:47:09.040internal API endpoint to get the
2:47:06.240" end="02:47:11.279transcript, you do it from a different
2:47:09.040" end="02:47:13.120residential IP address. And if you use
2:47:11.279" end="02:47:14.800web share, they have literally millions.
2:47:13.120" end="02:47:16.880So every time it's a different IP
2:47:14.800" end="02:47:19.200address and they would never be able to
2:47:16.880" end="02:47:21.200to track that. So this is a very it's a
2:47:19.200" end="02:47:22.960very production ready way because
2:47:21.200" end="02:47:25.760literally you'll never run into any
2:47:22.960" end="02:47:27.279issues with this because it will look it
2:47:25.760" end="02:47:29.359will literally just go through all of
2:47:27.279" end="02:47:31.359these and it will never be able to track
2:47:29.359" end="02:47:33.920that since it's a public API. That's why
2:47:31.359" end="02:47:36.331that's possible. And it's also the same
2:47:33.920" end="02:47:38.080API that YouTube is actually using
2:47:36.331" end="02:47:41.200[clears throat] under the hood to load
2:47:38.080" end="02:47:43.680in the transcript for each video. That's
2:47:41.200" end="02:47:45.920what the YouTube transcript API is built
2:47:43.680" end="02:47:47.680upon. It essentially like bypasses that
2:47:45.920" end="02:47:51.680internal API. It's really interesting
2:47:47.680" end="02:47:54.000actually. So now if we come over here to
2:47:51.680" end="02:47:56.560our builds,
2:47:54.000" end="02:47:59.520we should have another build in here cuz
2:47:56.560" end="02:48:02.560what I now want to check, I want to one
2:47:59.520" end="02:48:04.800more time get rid of all the tables and
2:48:02.560" end="02:48:06.800I want to do the final check to see if
2:48:04.800" end="02:48:10.399we can now get the three things right.
2:48:06.800" end="02:48:12.560We need the the open AAI one article at
2:48:10.399" end="02:48:14.800least and I think two YouTube videos.
2:48:12.560" end="02:48:18.240That's what what we should have in here.
2:48:14.800" end="02:48:21.120So let's see. This should finish in a
2:48:18.240" end="02:48:24.080couple of seconds. Complete. Now we're
2:48:21.120" end="02:48:27.359going to trigger the run once more.
2:48:24.080" end="02:48:31.680There we go. Scraping everything.
2:48:27.359" end="02:48:34.160Processing OpenAI GPT 5.1.
2:48:31.680" end="02:48:35.920Okay, that's looking good. Sending the
2:48:34.160" end="02:48:38.800email.
2:48:35.920" end="02:48:40.720Is this now ranking? Three digests for
2:48:38.800" end="02:48:44.000email generation.
2:48:40.720" end="02:48:48.560Send. Okay. Do we have three articles in
2:48:44.000" end="02:48:52.080here? There we go. There we go.
2:48:48.560" end="02:48:55.680Love it. Okay, that's it. That that that
2:48:52.080" end="02:48:57.520now we have now I'm I'm comfortable with
2:48:55.680" end="02:49:00.240this project now. Like you can go
2:48:57.520" end="02:49:02.399through this and like I said, this is
2:49:00.240" end="02:49:03.680pretty pretty serious, guys. This is
2:49:02.399" end="02:49:05.439pretty serious. If you're still here
2:49:03.680" end="02:49:07.680with me, by the way, and you managed to
2:49:05.439" end="02:49:10.000follow through all of this, this is it's
2:49:07.680" end="02:49:11.840pretty insane. This is I I don't think
2:49:10.000" end="02:49:14.399I've ever done a video like this deep
2:49:11.840" end="02:49:18.000and this advanced on on my YouTube
2:49:14.399" end="02:49:19.840channel. So yeah, this is I I hope you
2:49:18.000" end="02:49:22.240like it. I hope this is going to help
2:49:19.840" end="02:49:24.960you a lot if you made it through. So now
2:49:22.240" end="02:49:26.319what's next actually
2:49:24.960" end="02:49:29.279there are a couple of things that you
2:49:26.319" end="02:49:31.279can do right now. So first of all, you
2:49:29.279" end="02:49:33.520can try of course and experiment with
2:49:31.279" end="02:49:35.040adding different RSS feeds. I think
2:49:33.520" end="02:49:36.960that's the that's the most interesting
2:49:35.040" end="02:49:38.880one to to look at for you to continue
2:49:36.960" end="02:49:40.960this and this will also really give you
2:49:38.880" end="02:49:43.279a good understanding to look do I
2:49:40.960" end="02:49:46.960actually understand how this how this
2:49:43.279" end="02:49:48.880works how how this all is set up so go
2:49:46.960" end="02:49:50.399through some other like interesting
2:49:48.880" end="02:49:52.800stuff that you want to add in there so
2:49:50.399" end="02:49:54.800that's one thing then also where you can
2:49:52.800" end="02:49:57.600do a lot of stuff of course is in the
2:49:54.800" end="02:49:59.680agent in in the agent process right so
2:49:57.600" end="02:50:04.240we of course have we have the curator
2:49:59.680" end="02:50:07.040prompt we have our profile which is
2:50:04.240" end="02:50:09.920where is that actually where did we
2:50:07.040" end="02:50:13.120where did we move our profile user
2:50:09.920" end="02:50:16.080profile where let's see where did we
2:50:13.120" end="02:50:17.760move that profiles oh it's I'm not sure
2:50:16.080" end="02:50:19.840why I did not see that so of course you

2:50:19.840" end="02:50:25.920something you want to want to adjust and
2:50:23.120" end="02:50:29.120then you also like do you what kind of
2:50:25.920" end="02:50:31.760in the email agent where is the let's
2:50:29.120" end="02:50:33.359see we have the in the services we have
2:50:31.760" end="02:50:35.760the email so here's the whole mark.
2:50:33.359" end="02:50:37.760Here's the whole HTML of how you process
2:50:35.760" end="02:50:39.520it. So, you can adjust like what do I
2:50:37.760" end="02:50:41.279want things to look like? How much
2:50:39.520" end="02:50:42.800articles do I want? How do I want to
2:50:41.279" end="02:50:44.479score articles? How much do I want in
2:50:42.800" end="02:50:47.600there? And what's going to be my profile
2:50:44.479" end="02:50:50.960that we're going to make it specific to?
2:50:47.600" end="02:50:53.040And you could like not not going to lie,
2:50:50.960" end="02:50:55.920this is this is you could literally like
2:50:53.040" end="02:50:58.319turn this into
2:50:55.920" end="02:50:59.840a software. You could literally say,
2:50:58.319" end="02:51:02.080&quot;Hey,
2:50:59.840" end="02:51:04.720go create an application.
2:51:02.080" end="02:51:07.040I I may just actually do that like as in
2:51:04.720" end="02:51:08.960continuation of this project. I may
2:51:07.040" end="02:51:12.240actually do this or I'm like look hey
2:51:08.960" end="02:51:15.520imagine this landing page like get your
2:51:12.240" end="02:51:18.000favorite AI news delivered every day to
2:51:15.520" end="02:51:20.399your inbox tailored to you. You let
2:51:18.000" end="02:51:23.279people create an account. You have their
2:51:20.399" end="02:51:25.840email. They pretty much plug in their
2:51:23.279" end="02:51:27.760profile what they're interested in and
2:51:25.840" end="02:51:30.880then you would just expand this where
2:51:27.760" end="02:51:33.200you make this very very large. And then
2:51:30.880" end="02:51:36.399you could say, look, you could try it
2:51:33.200" end="02:51:38.319one week for free. So one week you just
2:51:36.399" end="02:51:41.359like get all of the articles every day
2:51:38.319" end="02:51:44.160and then boom, you need to get on like
2:51:41.359" end="02:51:46.640what would people pay for this? 10 bucks
2:51:44.160" end="02:51:48.640a month, 20 bucks a month, something
2:51:46.640" end="02:51:50.000like that. I think that could work. You
2:51:48.640" end="02:51:51.760build a service around that. And then
2:51:50.000" end="02:51:53.439you can also say, look, how often do you
2:51:51.760" end="02:51:56.080want the digest rights? Do you want it
2:51:53.439" end="02:51:59.120every 24 hours or do you want to have it
2:51:56.080" end="02:52:00.800every week? It's a product. It's a
2:51:59.120" end="02:52:03.439product. you could you could build this
2:52:00.800" end="02:52:06.399out and here's the foundation you can I
2:52:03.439" end="02:52:08.800I believe you can make money with this.
2:52:06.399" end="02:52:11.680So those are all things that you can now
2:52:08.800" end="02:52:12.960that you can now do, right? Also, one
2:52:11.680" end="02:52:14.399thing that I haven't covered and I'm
2:52:12.960" end="02:52:16.560really going to wrap it up right now,
2:52:14.399" end="02:52:18.399you should ideally also look into
2:52:16.560" end="02:52:20.800protecting your database base, right?
2:52:18.399" end="02:52:22.720Because now it's publicly exposed. So
2:52:20.800" end="02:52:24.560pretty much any IP address could connect
2:52:22.720" end="02:52:27.040to it.
2:52:24.560" end="02:52:29.040You want to ideally whitelist one of
2:52:27.040" end="02:52:30.880your IP. So what we're for example on,
2:52:29.040" end="02:52:32.560let's see, can I can I show this? I
2:52:30.880" end="02:52:34.960think I can show this. Yeah, we're using
2:52:32.560" end="02:52:36.560a N layer. We have a day luminina
2:52:34.960" end="02:52:38.720gateway where we have a fixed IP
2:52:36.560" end="02:52:41.520address. So we use this for all our
2:52:38.720" end="02:52:44.479agency work where whenever we have a
2:52:41.520" end="02:52:46.000serious project. So this is N layer. You
2:52:44.479" end="02:52:48.479could look into that. We get a static
2:52:46.000" end="02:52:50.800IP. So me and everyone on the team uses
2:52:48.479" end="02:52:53.600the same IP address and then we can go
2:52:50.800" end="02:52:55.760can go in here and
2:52:53.600" end="02:52:57.520we can probably I'm not sure where we
2:52:55.760" end="02:53:00.720can configure that. It's probably going
2:52:57.520" end="02:53:02.640to be in the settings somewhere.
2:53:00.720" end="02:53:04.240Schedule log stream. You will have to
2:53:02.640" end="02:53:07.359figure that out. Maybe it's it's at the
2:53:04.240" end="02:53:09.600blueprint level, but we autosync. Yeah,
2:53:07.359" end="02:53:11.359there should be a way to whitelist IP
2:53:09.600" end="02:53:12.880addresses. So, that's also something you
2:53:11.359" end="02:53:15.040want to you want to have in there as
2:53:12.880" end="02:53:16.720this gets more serious, especially as it
2:53:15.040" end="02:53:18.800starts to contain user information.
2:53:16.720" end="02:53:21.040Right now, it's all public data. So,
2:53:18.800" end="02:53:24.399doesn't really matter as much, but still
2:53:21.040" end="02:53:25.920something to keep in mind. Ah, so here's
2:53:24.399" end="02:53:27.760like you would definitely do that on the
2:53:25.920" end="02:53:29.200database level. So, if I scroll all the
2:53:27.760" end="02:53:31.279way down over here, look here, you can
2:53:29.200" end="02:53:34.240see the inbound IP restrictions. So
2:53:31.279" end="02:53:37.920right now it's set to like 00 0. This
2:53:34.240" end="02:53:40.640means any IP range can access this. I
2:53:37.920" end="02:53:43.439would then plug in my own private IP
2:53:40.640" end="02:53:45.920address and then when I'm working with
2:53:43.439" end="02:53:47.760it, render would set it up so that
2:53:45.920" end="02:53:49.840internally the services can connect with
2:53:47.760" end="02:53:52.080each other. So of course the chron job
2:53:49.840" end="02:53:53.920needs to be able to the environment from
2:53:52.080" end="02:53:58.160or server from which is run should be
2:53:53.920" end="02:54:00.319able to uh work with that. So, I think
2:53:58.160" end="02:54:02.240that should probably already be pretty
2:54:00.319" end="02:54:04.720much handled out of the box by render.
2:54:02.240" end="02:54:07.920But then for if I wanted to connect to
2:54:04.720" end="02:54:11.200it locally, I would pretty much fill
2:54:07.920" end="02:54:14.000this in. So, there you have it. You made
2:54:11.200" end="02:54:15.920it to the end of this big video. Like I
2:54:14.000" end="02:54:17.760said, I hope you learned a lot. This was
2:54:15.920" end="02:54:20.960really different from most of the other
2:54:17.760" end="02:54:22.800videos that I do on my channel. And I
2:54:20.960" end="02:54:25.200think the most valuable aspect of this
2:54:22.800" end="02:54:27.600video is not really the code that we
2:54:25.200" end="02:54:29.760generated, but more the thought process
2:54:27.600" end="02:54:32.399and showing you really behind the scenes
2:54:29.760" end="02:54:35.840of how I think about it, how I use it,
2:54:32.399" end="02:54:38.080the different tools, how I architect my
2:54:35.840" end="02:54:40.160application and then use AI on top of
2:54:38.080" end="02:54:42.960that while still being in control. So
2:54:40.160" end="02:54:45.920this is not vibe coding, this is AI
2:54:42.960" end="02:54:48.000assisted coding, this is agentic coding.
2:54:45.920" end="02:54:50.080And if you found this video helpful,
2:54:48.000" end="02:54:51.279please also consider liking it. You
2:54:50.080" end="02:54:52.479should definitely leave a like at this
2:54:51.279" end="02:54:54.960point if you're still here. Also,
2:54:52.479" end="02:54:56.479subscribe to the channel. And I want to
2:54:54.960" end="02:54:59.439quickly tell you a little bit more about
2:54:56.479" end="02:55:01.040our data luminina academy because if if
2:54:59.439" end="02:55:02.880you've gone through this video, it means
2:55:01.040" end="02:55:04.960you're a pretty capable engineer
2:55:02.880" end="02:55:06.640already. And the data luma academy is
2:55:04.960" end="02:55:09.920really here to take you to the next
2:55:06.640" end="02:55:13.040level. So I will link it down below, but
2:55:09.920" end="02:55:13.840we have primarily like two main programs
2:55:13.040" end="02:55:15.600that could really [clears throat] be
2:55:13.840" end="02:55:18.319interesting for you and that is either
2:55:15.600" end="02:55:20.399the Genai Accelerator or data freelancer
2:55:18.319" end="02:55:24.240or maybe they're both interesting. So
2:55:20.399" end="02:55:27.920our Genai Accelerator is our six week
2:55:24.240" end="02:55:30.080track really to turn you into from a
2:55:27.920" end="02:55:32.000developer into like a really capable AI
2:55:30.080" end="02:55:35.439engineer. So that I know that in this
2:55:32.000" end="02:55:37.680YouTube video we showed a lot already,
2:55:35.439" end="02:55:40.399but I went super fast, right? Because
2:55:37.680" end="02:55:42.319this was a live build. If you fully want
2:55:40.399" end="02:55:44.479to understand all of the individual
2:55:42.319" end="02:55:46.960components all the way from architecting
2:55:44.479" end="02:55:49.840AI systems to way more complex agent
2:55:46.960" end="02:55:52.399builds to prompting to setting up API
2:55:49.840" end="02:55:55.840endpoints using web hooks all the way
2:55:52.399" end="02:55:57.920through rag evals and deployment.
2:55:55.840" end="02:55:59.680This is the track for you. We've worked
2:55:57.920" end="02:56:02.319with students working at companies like
2:55:59.680" end="02:56:05.520Booking, Intel, EA, Accenture, Meta,
2:56:02.319" end="02:56:07.680Oracle. So we have an insane amount of
2:56:05.520" end="02:56:09.279people, talent engineers in here that
2:56:07.680" end="02:56:11.439went through this program and the
2:56:09.279" end="02:56:14.319feedback so far has been really good. So
2:56:11.439" end="02:56:16.640this is if you want to go really deep on
2:56:14.319" end="02:56:18.560the technical aspect of AI engineering.
2:56:16.640" end="02:56:20.399It's a technical track. It's split up in
2:56:18.560" end="02:56:22.720six weeks, but you have lifetime access.
2:56:20.399" end="02:56:25.040You can take however long you want to
2:56:22.720" end="02:56:27.279complete this. This is just for from an
2:56:25.040" end="02:56:29.520organizational point of view about how
2:56:27.279" end="02:56:32.800we've set that up. Okay, look, if you
2:56:29.520" end="02:56:36.000say Dave, I I already understand this. I
2:56:32.800" end="02:56:38.800I am already a very capable engineer. I
2:56:36.000" end="02:56:40.720already built I already built projects
2:56:38.800" end="02:56:42.240in my day-to-day job, whether that's AI
2:56:40.720" end="02:56:43.279engineering, data science, machine
2:56:42.240" end="02:56:45.920learning engineering, software
2:56:43.279" end="02:56:47.359engineering, and you say, &quot;Hey, I also
2:56:45.920" end="02:56:50.240want to do what you do with data
2:56:47.359" end="02:56:52.000luminina and work on my own projects.&quot;
